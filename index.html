<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://bookdownloadpagehere.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>The Rocketmakers</h2><p>Tells the little-known story of the race to develop rocket propulsion, focusing on the scientists and engineers who created the rockets the astronauts rode</p><p>In an informative and entertaining history of rocketry, from Robert Goddard's experiments in the 1920s to President Kennedy's 1961 decision to launch the manned lunar program, Wulforst ( Breakthrough to the Computer Age ) covers a lot of territory in a nontechnical style. He describes Wernher von Braun's work on the V-1 and V-2 "buzz bombs" and his postwar career in the U.S. missile program; the contributions of Theodore von Karmann and his proteges at Caltech's Jet Propulsion Lab, Frank Malina and Hsue-Shen Tsien (the former quit in protest over the increasingly military application of missile technology, the latter ran afoul of McCarthyite hysteria); and infuses the story of the mating of rocketry and nuclear weapons with a dramatic account of the rivalry between the Army and the Air Force over dominance of rocket research and development. This is a first-class popular history about the dreamers, tinkerers, scientists and engineers who struggled against great odds to break through the space barrier.

This chronicle examines the origin of TABASCO� sauce, from its post-Civil War creation on Avery Island, Louisiana, to its evolution into the "gold standard" of pepper sauces and a global culinary icon. </p><p>It also examines the often stranger-than-fiction stories that are inexorably bound up with the rise of TABASCO�--Edmund McIlhenny's creation of the sauce in the midst of Reconstruction-era economic ruin; John Avery McIlhenny's adventures in Theodore Roosevelt's Rough Riders volunteer cavalry regiment; Edward Avery McIlhenny's explorations in the unforgiving Arctic; and Walter S. McIlhenny's amazing heroics in World War II, which eventually secured him the rank of brigadier general, even as he modernized his family business and ensured its success into the late Twentieth century. </p><p>In addition to the central narrative, <i>TABASCO�: An Illustrated History</i> contains numerous detailed sidebars, as well as over a dozen historical recipes selected from handwritten McIlhenny family cookbooks and other archival sources.

Literally, no two people are alike. Each one has a specific genetic inheritance indelibly stamped upon every cell. Environmental influences from the company one keeps, and experiences that one endures, blend to enrich and educate the person who ultimately emerges from this marvelous experience we call life. With rare insight, gained through service as both a world-renowned heart surgeon and a Church leader, Elder Russell M. Nelson, a member of the Council of the Twelve Apostles in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, writes about the unique powers and potential of each individual. &#34;The potential for divine power is within us,&#34; he says. &#34;It awaits the grasp of each willing child of God.&#34; Some of the attributes each person must develop in order to achieve divine power are: &#34;The potential for divine power is within us,&#34; he says. &#34;It awaits the grasp of each willing child of God.&#34; Some of the attrib</p><p></p><h2>Sody Salleratus</h2><p>A simple trip to the store for a box of sody salleratus (baking soda) turns into a disappearing act for a boy, a girl, an old man and an old woman. It&#39;s all up to a little squirrel -- who&#39;s determined to have biscuits for supper -- to discover their fate and rescue them. The simple plot, filled with lots of repetition and fun-to-repeat sounds, is perfect for reading aloud. Exuberant illustrations by Alan and Lea Daniel leap off the page, adding hilarious details that enhance this lively retelling of the traditional tale.</p><p>Aubrey Davis is a teacher and storyteller. His books include Bone Button Borscht and The Enormous Potato. He lives in Toronto, Ontario.<br><br>Alan Daniel Together and independently, husband and wife artists Alan and Lea Daniel have illustrated scores of children&#x2019;s books, including The Dream Collector and Sody Salleratus. They live in Kitchener, Ontario.Davis (Bone Button Borscht) narrates this lackluster retelling of the mountain-home folktale, borrowed from Richard Chase's Grandfather Tales (1948), without attempting the vernacular. The plain-spoken introduction presents all the characters but one: "Once upon a time there was an old woman, an old man, a girl, a boy and a squirrel that lived on the mantelpiece." Boy goes to the general store to buy some sody salleratus, or baking soda, for making biscuits. On the way home, he disturbs a huge golden-brown grizzly, who growls, "Who's that walking on my bridge?" "It's me-Boy. Me and my Sody Salleratus," the child answers, and is promptly eaten. One by one, the family members cross the bridge (with an onomatopoeic "skumpity-skip" or "crunkity-crunk") and meet the same fate. Only the squirrel evades the bear, by enticing him to a fragile branch; the monster falls from the tree and "bust[s] wide open." In a grotesque closing image, the squirrel leans on the head of a brand-new bearskin rug, gorging itself on sody-salleratus biscuits. While the bear and especially the squirrel are closely observed, the caricaturish hillbillies have toothy yokel grins, knobby knees and dirty bare feet. Using pencil and acrylics, Alan and Leah Daniel (the Bunnicula books) note such details as wood-burning stoves and handwoven baskets, but don't create much of a hillbilly homestead. For a warmer, down-homier rendition, try Teri Sloat's picture book, Sody Sallyratus.

Thus, if they are right, the Book of Enoch must be a forgery, as it itself says that it is written by the preflood patriarch Enoch, thus making it the oldest book in the world. As a Bible believing christian, you must consider why then the brother of Jesus, the apostle Jude, did quote this &#x201c;forgery&#x201d;. Either he and the whole bunch of apostles (because they too, were in�fluenced by the Book of Enoch) were foolish enough to buy this false book &#x2013; or it must be older than what the scholars say, and written by the one it says is the author: Enoch himself.</b> <br><br> What if it could be proved that the Book of Enoch IS older than what the scholars say? What if this book in itself can prove it? Because if it was written 5000 years ago, wouldn't there be some traces in it (geographical, or astronomical), perhaps hidden to people in the centuries before Christ, but possible for us in our technological time, to discover? <br><br> I believe that I have found such evidence &#x2013; evidence that proves &#x2018;beyond doubt&#x2019;, that the Book of Enoch IS 5000 years old, and I'm going to tell about it in this book, and how I discovered it.<br> <i><b>In this book, you will learn,</b></i><br><br> 1. How Enoch was taken by the angels of God to Antarctica, and from there to the Pleiades, to see the place were the 7 primeval angels are imprisoned, and where the corrupted watchers were to be bound.<br> 2. The location of Tartarus, the bottomless pit - not in the earth, but UNDER the earth.<br> 3. The dividing in Peleg's days, which was not the break up of the continents, but the division of the nations under a new group of angelic, corrupted watchers.<br> 4. How Gilgal Refaim in the Golan Heights fits the description in the Book of Enoch of the burial place of Azazel.<br> 5. What the key to the Abyss is, and where its opening is located.<br> 6. How archeology and the Book of Enoch agree about when and where humanity learned to read and write.<br> 7. How the Book of Enoch has been the instrument of God in three points in time, and how these three correspond to the three transitions between the ages of Taurus, Aries, and Pisces.<br> 8. How the Gilgal Refaim astronomical "clock" is set to exactly the time when, according to Enoch and Noah, Azazel and the 200 watchers were gathered and buried under stone mounds.</p><p></p><h2>Let Us Have Peace: Ulysses S. Grant and the Politics of War and Reconstruction, 1861-1868 (Civil War America)</h2><p>Historians have traditionally drawn distinctions between Ulysses S. Grant's military and political careers. In <i>Let Us Have Peace</i>, Brooks Simpson questions such distinctions and offers a new understanding of this often enigmatic leader. He argues that during the 1860s Grant was both soldier and politician, for military and civil policy were inevitably intertwined during the Civil War and Reconstruction era. According to Simpson, Grant instinctively understood that war was 'politics by other means.' Moreover, he realized that civil wars presented special challenges: reconciliation, not conquest, was the Union's ultimate goal. And in peace, Grant sought to secure what had been won in war, stepping in to assume a more active role in policymaking when the intransigence of white Southerners and the obstructionist behavior of President Andrew Johnson threatened to spoil the fruits of Northern victory.<br><br></p><p>" <i>Let Us Have Peace</i> deserves to take a well-merited place in Civil War and Reconstruction literature.

He is commonly considered the greatest CIGS in the history of the British Army. His diaries&#x2014;published here for the first time in complete and unexpurgated form&#x2014;are one of the most important and the most controversial military diaries of the modern era. The last great chronicle of the Second World War, they provide a riveting blow-by-blow account of how the war was waged and eventually won&#x2014;including the controversies over the Second Front and the desperate search for a strategy, the Allied bomber offensive, the Italian campaign, the D-day landings, the race for Berlin, the divisions of Yalta, and the postwar settlement.<br><br>Beginning in September 1939, the diaries were written up each night in the strictest secrecy and against all regulations. Alanbrooke's mask of command was legendary but these diaries tell us what he really saw and felt: moments of triumph and exhilaration, but also frustration, depression, betrayal, and doubt. They expose the gulf between the military and the politicians of the War Cabinet, and how often military strategy was misguided and nearly derailed by political prejudices. They also reveal the incredible strain on Alanbrooke of the Allied conferences in Washington, Moscow, Casablanca, Quebec, and Tehran, as he tried after intense and exhausting argument (not least with Churchill) to match Allied strategy with the reality of British military power and the fragility of the British Empire. These diaries demonstrate the true depth of Alanbrooke's rage and despair at Churchill's failure to grasp overall strategy. This was particularly acute in the winter of 1943&#x2013;44 when Churchill, fueled by medicine and alcohol, no longer seemed master of himself.</p><p><b>Alex Danchev</b> is Professor of International Relations at Keele University.

And the wonderful thing is that 3/4 of the population of the world imagine that Winston Churchill is one of the great Strategists of History...Without him England was lost for certainty, with him England has been on the verge of disaster time and time again.&#34; Churchill on Alanbrooke: &#34;I thump the table and push my face towards him, what does he do? Thumps the table harder and glares back at me.&#34; Alanbrooke on Eisenhower: &#34;I am afraid that Eisenhower as a general is hopeless! He submerges himself in politics and neglects his military duties, partly, I am afraid, because he knows little if anything about military matters.&#34; Alanbrooke on Stalin: &#34;He has got an unpleasantly cold, crafty, dead face and whenever I look at him I can imagine his sending people off to their doom without even turning a hair.&#34;</p><h2>The Complete Kubrick</h2><p>With just thirteen feature films in half a century, Stanley Kubrick established himself as one of the most accomplished directors in motion picture history. Kubrick created a landmark and a benchmark with every film; working in almost every genre imaginable, including film noir, war movie, SF, horror, period drama, historical epic, love story and satire - yet transcended traditional genre boundaries with every shot. Examining every feature film, from the early shorts through to classics such as Paths of Glory, Dr Strangelove, 2001: A Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange, The Shining, Full Metal Jacket and finally, Eyes Wide Shut, The Complete Kubrick provides a unique insight into understanding the work of cinema&#39;s most enigmatic, iconoclastic and gifted auteur.</p><p>Part of the Virgin Complete Directors series, The Complete Kubrick is the step-by-step companion to the work of Stanley Kubrick.

Born in Medford, MA, her grandfather&#39;s house still stands near the Mystic River as a tangible reminder of her most memorable poem.PreS - Grade 2-- This attractive new presentation of Child's 1844 poem,"A Boy's Thanksgiving Day," offers 13 full-page watercolors done in a detailed and delicately primitive style. As befits this style, the figures are somewhat stiff, and the overall effect is static. The colors are pleasingly light and clear. The childlike illustrations are in keeping with the unsophisticated nature of the rhyming text. Unlike the version illustrated with lively energy by Brinton Turkle (Coward, 1974), only 6 of the 12 verses are included, a streamlining that modern preschool and primary-grade teachers may well appreciate. The text is placed unobtrusively in the sky or on the snow-covered ground, and probably sings better than it reads. A piano arrangement of the familiar melody, a traditional French folk tune, is placed after the text. Child's time-honored poem successfully evokes the happy mood of a traditional and idealized family holiday gathering. --Cynthia Bishop, Onondaga County Public Library, Syracuse, NY<br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Tolkien&#39;s World from A to Z: The Complete Reference Guide to Middle-Earth</h2><p>Tolkien&#39;s World From A To Z: The Complete Reference Guide to Middle-Earth Authors: Robert Foster Publisher: Del Rey / Ballantine Keywords: middle, earth, guide, reference, world, complete, Tolkein Published: 1978 Language: English ISBN-10: 0739432974 ISBN-13: 9780739432976 Binding: Hardcover</p><p></p><h2>Vivas to Those Who Have Failed: Poems</h2><p><p><strong>Award-winning poet Mart�n Espada gives voice to the spirit of endurance in the face of loss.</strong></p><p>In this powerful new collection of poems, Mart�n Espada articulates the transcendent vision of another, possible world. He invokes the words of Whitman in &#x201c;Vivas to Those Who Have Failed,&#x201d; a cycle of sonnets about the Paterson Silk Strike and the immigrant laborers who envisioned an eight-hour workday. At the heart of this volume is a series of ten poems about the death of the poet&#x2019;s father. &#x201c;El Moriviv�&#x201d; uses the metaphor of a plant that grows in Puerto Rico to celebrate the many lives of Frank Espada, community organizer, civil rights activist, and documentary photographer, from a jailhouse in Mississippi to the streets of Brooklyn. The son lyrically imagines his father&#x2019;s return to a bay in Puerto Rico: &#x201c;May the water glow blue as a hyacinth in your hands.&#x201d; Other poems confront collective grief in the wake of the killings at the Sandy Hook Elementary School and police violence against people of color: &#x201c;Heal the Cracks in the Bell of the World&#x201d; urges us to &#x201c;melt the bullets into bells.&#x201d; Yet the poet also revels in the absurd, recalling his dubious career as a Shakespearean &#x201c;actor,&#x201d; finding madness and tenderness in the crowd at Fenway Park. In exquisitely wrought images, Espada&#x2019;s poems show us the faces of Whitman&#x2019;s &#x201c;numberless unknown heroes.&#x201d;</p></p><p>Mart�n Espada is the author of fourteen collections of poetry, including the Pulitzer Prize finalist The Republic of Poetry and, most recently, Vivas to Those Who Have Failed. His many honors include the Ruth Lilly Prize, the Shelley Memorial Award, and a Guggenheim Fellowship. He teaches at the University of Massachusetts&#x2013;Amherst.&#x201c;In a passionate collection that is socially conscious and personal, ecstatic and elegiac all at once, Martin Espada&#x2019;s collection of poems <em>Vivas to Those Who Have Failed</em> should be read again and again, silently and aloud, in sadness and celebration of those who have fought throughout history and refuse to be forgotten.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Massachusetts Review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;This poet&#x2019;s work breathes life into those who failed&#x2015;the downtrodden, the forgotten, and the dead&#x2015;so that their voices may speak to us now....Espada&#x2019;s poems act as a salve for today&#x2019;s violence, just as Whitman&#x2019;s poems dress the wounds of the Civil War.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Rumpus</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Espada at his brilliant best, the poet laureate of our New America, with a voice that breaks heart, gives courage and burns all illusions.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Junot D�az</strong><br><br>&#x201c;In the battle against forgetfulness, in the ongoing war against dumb distraction and voluntary blindness, Mart�n Espada is our Subcomandante. With an ear sweetened by long listening to voices most often unheard, he writes poems that resonate like bells forged of bronze and blood.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Tim Seibles</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Mart�n Espada is one of the few poets in our time who really matters, because his words matter, and the people and the world he writes about matter.

They even acknowledge that our languages are similar and that this implies a shared ancient history. Still, they remain convinced that war with Lon-Ser is not only possible but perhaps inevitable. Many of us in the Order have tried to convince them that this is not the case, that we have little to fear from you, but even the people who live in Order towns remain skeptical. More than ten years have passed since the outlanders burned our villages and killed our people, but the scars are still fresh</i>.<br>-Hawk-Mage Orris to Melyor i Lakin, Sovereign and Bearer of Bragor-Nal, Winter, God's Year 4633.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>He is standing in a field he does not recognize, squinting up into a bright blue sky. Above him, two birds do battle, wheeling and stooping, talons outstretched and beaks open. They are enormous, and framed as they are against the sun and the blue, they appear almost utterly black.<br>For one terrifying instant he fears that the outlanders have returned. But the outlanders' birds would not fight each other, and both of these creatures are crying out stridently, something the mechanical hawks from Lon-Ser never did. So he watches, marveling at the size and grace of the winged combatants, though troubled at the sight of their slashing claws and beaks. Yet, even with his eyes riveted on the struggle taking place above him, he senses another presence in the clearing.<br>Tearing his gaze from the birds, he sees a woman standing on the far side of the field. She has straight brown hair and pale eyes, and there is something vaguely familiar about her. For a disorienting moment he wonders if this s his daughter, grown suddenly into a woman. But when he hears her laugh, malicious and bitter, he knows that this cannot be. He opens his mouth to ask her name, but before he can he hears a piercing wail from above.<br>The two birds are locked together now, their talons digging into each other's flesh and their wings beating desperately though in unison, as if even in the throes of battle they are working together to keep themselves aloft. But their efforts are in vain. Toppling one over the other, they fall to the ground, landing at his feet. They are dead, though whether from the impact or the damage they have inflicted on one another, it is impossible to tell. And seeing them at last, their carcasses bathed in the sunlight that had obscured their color and features just seconds before, he cries out in despair.<br>* * *<br>Jaryd awoke with a start and found himself immersed in darkness. He heard Alayna beside him, her breathing slow and deep, but otherwise all was still. Lying back against his pillow, he took a long, steadying breath and closed his eyes. He knew better than to try to go back to sleep. His heart was racing, and his hair was damp with sweat. He was awake for the day. He opened his eyes again and stared up toward the ceiling, although he could see nothing for the darkness.<br>"You up again?" Alayna asked him in a muffled, sleepy voice.<br>"Yes," he whispered. "Go back to sleep." She said something in reply that he couldn't make out, and a moment later her breathing slowed again.<br>He couldn't remember the last time he had slept through the night. It wasn't that he slept poorly. For the first several hours, he slept like the dead. But every day for weeks on end he had awakened before dawn, sometimes spontaneously and other times, as today, out of a dream. At first he had taken his sleeplessness as a sign that something was coming; that perhaps, not too long from now, he would bind again, and end this interminable wait. But slowly, as each day passed without a new familiar appearing, he began to accept that there was nothing more to it than the obvious: he was just waking up too early.<br>Usually during these predawn hours he tried to clear his mind using the exercises he had first learned so many years ago, when he was a Mage-Attend to his uncle Baden. If he wasn't going to sleep, he reasoned, he might as well prepare himself for his next binding. But invariably, rather than quieting his emotions and taming the confused thoughts that came to him in the darkness, the exercises only served to heighten his feelings of loss.<br>His hawk, Ishalla, was gone. She had been since late summer. And though he had hoped that the agony of losing his first familiar would begin to abate with time, he was forced to admit that it hadn't. He had so much in his life: a cherished wife and daughter, a brother and mother to the north whom he loved, and friends throughout the land for whom he would gladly have given his life. He had served the communities on the western shores of Tobyn-Ser for nearly a dozen years, and in return he enjoyed the respect and affection of many of those who lived there. And yet, with all this, Ishalla's absence still left a void within him that he could scarcely fathom. Even the death of his father had not affected him so.<br>Time and again, he had watched people he loved, Baden, Trahn, Radomil, cope with the loss of their familiars. Orris had lost two familiars in the time Jaryd had known him, both of them as a result of violence. The first, a large impressive hawk, had been killed at Theron's Grove by the great owl carried by the traitor, Sartol. And the second, a dark falcon, died just over three years ago during one of Orris's many battles with members of the League, who had decided long ago that the burly mage deserved to die for what they viewed as his betrayal of the land.<br>Most recently, Alayna had lost Fylimar, the great grey hawk who had looked so much like Jaryd's Ishalla, that many in the Order had said that in sending them such similar familiars, the gods had marked Jaryd and Alayna for each other. Like Ishalla, Fylimar had died a natural death, one she had earned after a life of service to the land. This, of course, had not softened the blow for Alayna, any more than it had for Jaryd. But Alayna found a new familiar quite soon after Fylimar's death.<br>And what a binding it had been. She had left their home early in the day, leaving Jaryd to care for Myn, their daughter, and when she returned late that afternoon, she bore on her shoulder a large, yellow-eyed owl with great ear tufts. It was the same kind of bird to which Sartol, her mentor, had been bound, and it occurred to both Jaryd and Alayna that the gods were offering her a chance at redemption. "Sartol failed the land," they seemed to be saying. "Go now and make right all that he made wrong."<br>The others had bound again as well. Indeed, Trahn's binding to an owl had come just a few days after the death of his hawk, prompting Orris to suggest that owls had actually been waiting in line to become Trahn's familiar. Orris, too, had found his new familiar rather quickly. He was bound now to another falcon, this one larger than his last bird and as white as snow.<br>None of his friends had spent more than a season un-bound. Yet here was Jaryd, still without a familiar after nearly half a year. Alayna assured him that, notwithstanding her experience or Trahn's, being unbound for long stretches was a normal part of being a mage. And Baden, who communicated with him periodically using the <i>Ceryll-Var</i>, reminded him during one merging that Owl-Sage Jessamyn, Myn's namesake, who had been leader of the Order when Jaryd received his cloak, had spent more than a year unbound.<br>Such reassurances helped, but only a little. Certainly he didn't begrudge the others their bindings. He was deeply proud of Alayna, who had become the youngest Owl-Master within memory. But he could not help but wonder if he was ever going to bind again, or if he was destined to die unbound and become yet another victim of Theron's Curse.<br>He had spoken with Phelan, the Wolf-Master. He had endured the terrors of Theron's Grove, and he now carried Theron's staff as his own. He had seen what it was to be unsettled, and the very idea of it filled him with a cold, penetrating dread. But after all this time without finding a new familiar, Jaryd was forced to acknowledge that this might be his fate, that the sense of foreboding that hovered at his shoulder all day, and followed him to bed at night, might carry the weight of prophecy.<br>After struggling with his fears privately for some time, he mentioned this possibility to Alayna, who reacted predictably.<br>"That's ridiculous," she told him. "We're all afraid of Theron's Curse. That's just part of being a mage. It certainly doesn't mean that you're fated to become one of the Unsettled."<br>He nodded silently, accepting the logic of what she said. But later that day he noticed her watching him, concern etched on her delicate features. And he knew what she was thinking. <i>He has been unbound for such a long time</i>...<br>Oddly, Jaryd found comfort not in anything Alayna or Baden said to him, but rather in a lesson he had learned long ago from his father. Jaryd had never been very close to his father, and the distance between them had only increased after Jaryd became a mage. But while Bernel had been brusque and taciturn, he also had possessed a pragmatic wisdom that had manifested itself late in his life in terse, pointed maxims that he offered without warning to anyone who cared to listen.<br>One of these Jaryd heard for the first time when he took Alayna and Myn to Accalia so that his mother and father could meet their granddaughter for the first time. During the journey, Myn slept poorly, often refusing to nurse, and Jaryd and Alayna worried that something might be wrong with her.<br>"Worrying's a fine way to waste some time," Bernel finally said, after listening to them fret for an entire afternoon, "but it sure doesn't accomplish very much, except to annoy the rest of us."<br>Alayna had taken offense, prompting Drina to scold her husband for the balance of the day. But lying now in his bed, watching the room he and Alayna shared brighten slowly with the first grey glimmerings of daylight, Jaryd could only smile at the memory.<br>He glanced over at Alayna, who was still asleep. Her long dark hair was streaked with strands of silver, and her face was leaner than it had been when they first met eleven years ago. But the passage of the years had not diminished her beauty.<br><i>I can worry about becoming one of the Unsettled</i>, Jaryd told himself. <i>Or I can enjoy what the gods have given me until they decide that I'm ready for my next binding</i>.<br>He smiled in the silver light. It didn't strike him as a difficult choice.<br>He leaned over and kissed Alayna lightly on her forehead. Then he silently slipped out of bed, dressed, and wrapped his green cloak tightly around himself. Spring was approaching, but there was still a chill in the air.<br>He started toward the common room, intending to light a fire in the hearth, but as he walked past Myn's room he glanced inside and saw his daughter sitting beside her small window, bundled in a thick blanket, and reading a worn book of Cearbhall's fables.<br>"Good morning, Love," Jaryd said in a whisper.<br>She looked up from the book and smiled at him. With her long chestnut hair, perfect features, and dazzling smile she was the image of Alayna. All except her eyes, which were pale grey, just like Jaryd's and those of his own mother.<br>"Good morning, Papa!" she said.<br>Jaryd held a ringer to his lips and pointed back toward his bedroom. Myn covered her mouth, her eyes wide.<br>"What are you doing up so early?" he asked her quietly.<br>"I always wake up when you do," she whispered.<br>"How do you know when I wake up?"<br>She shrugged. "I don't know. I just do."<br>Jaryd gazed at her for several seconds, then nodded. That she showed signs of having the Sight, already, at the age of six, did not surprise them. Both he and Alayna had understood from the beginning that their child would not be ordinary. But she was attuned to both of her parents in strange and wondrous ways, some of them remarkably subtle and completely unexpected.<br>Jaryd stood in her doorway for another moment, watching her and grinning. She just looked back at him, saying nothing.<br>"I was going to make a fire and have some breakfast," he finally told her. "Are you hungry?"<br>She nodded, put the book on her bed, and, keeping the blanket around her shoulders as if it were an overly large cloak, followed him into the common room.<br>After lighting the fire, Jaryd cut two large pieces of the dark currant bread he had made the day before and covered them with sweet butter. They sat in the kitchen, and as they ate, Myn told him about the fable she had been working her way through when he found her. She was just learning to read, and Cearbhall's work was not the easiest to figure out. The fable she had been reading, however, was one of his favorites, <i>The Fox and the Skunk</i>, and he had read it to her many times when she was younger.<br>"It was smart of you to start with one you know already," he said, still speaking in a whisper.<br>She smiled, her mouth full of bread. "Mama picked it out."<br>Jaryd laughed. "Well, then it was smart of her."<br>He got up to cut some more bread, and as he did he heard the rustling of blankets in the other room.<br>"I think your mother's awake."<br>"She has been for a little while," Myn said. "I think she was listening to us."<br>Jaryd turned to look at her again.<br>"How did you know that, Myn-Myn?" Alayna asked, appearing in the kitchen doorway with Wyrinva, her great owl, sitting on her shoulder.<br>Myn looked at her mother and then at Jaryd, a shy smile on her lips. "I just know," she said, seeming embarrassed. "I can feel it when you're awake. Both of you."<br>Alayna glanced up at Jaryd and grinned.<br>"Is it bad that I can tell?"<br>"Not at all," Jaryd said.<br>"Does it mean I'm going to be a mage?"<br>Jaryd suppressed a laugh.<br>"I'd be very surprised if you weren't a mage," Alayna said, her eyes still on Jaryd. "And so would everyone else in Tobyn-Ser."<br>This time Jaryd couldn't help but laugh out loud. Since before she could walk, Orris and Baden had been saying that she was destined to be Owl-Sage, and though Jaryd and Alayna were determined to let Myn find her own path, neither of them doubted that she would bind someday, probably to Amarid's Hawk, just as they both had. The question was: would she join the Order or the League? Indeed, Jaryd could not even be certain that both would still exist by the time Myn was ready to choose. He shook his head. It was not a line of thought he cared to pursue just then.<br>"Good," Myn said. "I want to be a mage. I like going to Amarid."<br>"I'm glad you like going there," Alayna said, crossing to the bread and picking up the knife to cut herself a piece. "We like it, too."<br>"That's why I'm happy today."<br>Alayna turned to look at Myn, the knife poised over the loaf. "What do you mean, Myn-Myn?"<br>"I'm happy because we're going to Amarid soon."<br>"No, we're not, Love," Jaryd said gently. "It's still winter. The Gathering isn't until summer."<br>Myn smiled at him as if he were a child.

The vast crumbling castle to which the seventy-seventh Earl, Titus Groan, is Lord and heir. Titus is expected to rule this Gothic labyrinth of turrets and dungeons, cloisters and corridors as well as the eccentric and wayward subject. Things are changing in the castle and Titus must contend with a kingdom about to implode beneath the weight of centuries of intrigue, treachery, manipulation and murder.</p><p>Mervyn Peake's gothic masterpiece, the Gormenghast trilogy, begins with the superlative <i>Titus Groan</i>, a darkly humorous, stunningly complex tale of the first two years in the life of the heir to an ancient, rambling castle. The trilogy continues with the novels <i>Gormenghast</i> and <i>Titus Alone</i>, and all three books are bound together in this single-volume edition. <p> The Gormenghast royal family, the castle's decidedly eccentric staff, and the peasant artisans living around the dreary, crumbling structure make up the cast of characters in these engrossing stories. Peake's command of language and unique style set the tone and shape of an intricate, slow-moving world of ritual and stasis: </p><p> </p><blockquote>"The walls of the vast room which were streaming with calid moisture, were built with gray slabs of stone and were the personal concern of a company of eighteen men known as the 'Grey Scrubbers'.... On every day of the year from three hours before daybreak until about eleven o'clock, when the scaffolding and ladders became a hindrance to the cooks, the Grey Scrubbers fulfilled their hereditary calling."</blockquote> <p> Peake has been compared to Dickens, Tolkien, and Peacock, but the Gormenghast trilogy is truly unique. Unforgettable characters with names like Steerpike and Prunesquallor make their way through an architecturally stifling world, with lots of dark corners around to dampen any whimsy that might arise. This true classic is a feast of words unlike anything else in the world of fantasy. Those who explore Gormenghast castle will be richly rewarded. <i>--Therese Littleton</i></p>MERVYN PEAKE was born in 1911 in Kuling, Central Southern China, where his father was a medical missionary. His education began in China and then continued at Eltham College in South East London, followed by the Croydon School of Art and the Royal Academy Schools. Subsequently he became an artist, married the painter Maeve Gilmore in 1937 and had three children. During the Second World War he established a reputation as a gifted book illustrator for <b>Ride<br>a Cock Horse </b>(1940), <b>The Hunting of the Snark </b>(1941), and <b>The Rime of The Ancient Mariner </b>(1943).

She was, in her time, a highly significant and influential figure within spiritualistic circles: a one-time member of the Order of the Golden Dawn, she left it to create another society, the Fraternity of the Inner Light, which (under another name) still exists today; and which refuses to discuss her. During the 1920s and 1930s she wrote books, pamphlets, and articles about her spiritual philosophies and various sociological and sexual issues, including vegetarianism, the servant problem, and contraception. <p>She also turned her hand to fiction, writing novels which contained such elements as black and white magic, the great god Pan, astral bodies, reincarnation, and the lost city of Atlantis. When she died in 1946, Fortune left her final novel, MOON MAGIC, uncompleted; the last two chapters are said to have been dictated by her from beyond to one of the Inner Light mediums. </p><p>Her first work of fiction, however, was THE SECRETS OF DR TAVERNER, first published in 1926. The stories concern some of the psychic adventures of the Holmes-like Taverner, as narrated by his assistant, Dr Rhodes. In addition to containing the eleven stories from the first edition, this volume also includes a twelfth Dr Taverner tale, 'A Son of the Night', which was not published until some years after Fortune's death, and which has been the cause of some speculation regarding its authorship. In his lengthy introduction, Jack Adrian examines the enigma who was Dion Fortune, and provides a possible solution to the question of which real person served as the basis for Dr Taverner.</p></p><p>Dion Fortune was the name Violet Firth used in pursuit of her magical work. As the head of the Society of Inner Light, she dominated magic circles in England during the first half of the 20th century. She also wrote prolifically.

These first forty-two chapters of Alma are discussed in this volume of the series, The Record of Alma.

For many years he was a regular visitor to the Outer Banks. He was bewitched by the beauty of the landscape and fascinated by the legends that surrounded them. Although <i>Elemental</i> and <i>Firebrand </i>are set in the future, they have their origins in the islands' remote past&#x2014;an era of sailing ships, small, independent colonies, and still-unsolved mysteries. Antony now lives with his family in St. Louis, Missouri.This sequel to Elemental (2012) is quickly paced and jam-packed with action. Thomas and his friends are on the hunt for a new island to call home after battling pirates, the unknown terrors of the outside world, and sometimes themselves on Roanoke Island. Thomas&#x2019; newly discovered element comes in handy now as well as bolsters his previously flagging self-esteem. When the small band of hardy, desperate adventurers discovers a colony of people living on another island, hope flares until suspicious events threaten to tear apart the group of friends like nothing has yet. John realistically weaves dystopian elements into what could be a future America, using familiar settings and creating past situations that believably lead into Thomas&#x2019; story. The truth behind the division between elementals and nonelementals lingers throughout the story, finally revealing itself and creating even more plot twists to urge the characters along. A strong follow-up to an unusual, interesting postapocalyptic world dusted with just enough romantic and paranormal traces to attract a wider readership.

And this time, the message is urgent and impossible to ignore--River requires open-heart surgery, and Isabelle and her sisters are needed at home to run the family bakery and take care of their brother and ailing grandmother. <br><br>Isabelle has worked hard to leave Trillium River, Oregon, behind as she travels the globe taking award-winning photographs. It's not that Isabelle hates her family. On the contrary, she and her sisters Cecilia, an outspoken kindergarten teacher, and Janie, a bestselling author, share a deep, loving bond. And all of them adore their brother, Henry, whose disabilities haven't stopped him from helping out at the bakery and bringing good cheer to everyone in town. <br><br>But going home again has a way of forcing open the secrets and hurts that the Bommaritos would rather keep tightly closed--Isabelle's fleeting and too-frequent relationships, Janie's obsessive compulsive disorder, and Cecilia's self-destructive streak and grief over her husband's death. Working together to look after Henry and save their flagging bakery, Isabelle and her sisters begin to find answers to questions they never knew existed, unexpected ways to salve the wounds of their childhoods, and the courage to grasp surprising new chances at happiness. <br><br>Poignant, funny, and as irresistible as one of the Bommarito sisters' delicious giant cupcakes, <i>Henry's Sisters</i> is a novel about family and forgiveness, about mothers and daughters, and about gaining the wisdom to look ahead while still holding tight to everything that matters most. <br><br><b>Outstanding Praise For Cathy Lamb And Her Novels</b><br><br><b>The Last Time I Was Me</b><br><br>"Charming." --<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br><b>Julia's Chocolates</b><br><br><i>"Julia's Chocolates</i> is wise, tender, and very funny.

Visit her at cathylamb.net.When the Bommarito sisters, Isabelle and Janie, hear that their domineering mother is going in for open heart surgery, they must forget the trauma of their childhood and return to their riverside Oregon hometown, Trillium River. Taking care of their mother and their demented grandmother (who believes she's Amelia Earhart) and watching after their mentally handicapped brother, Henry (possessed of an almost saintly, unconditional love for people), the independent sisters try to find a place in the world they've left behind. Lamb (The Last Time I Was Me) delivers grace, humor and forgiveness along with a litany of family trauma, which might seem heavy-handed in lesser hands. Fortunately, this finely pitched family melodrama is balanced with enough gallows humor and idiosyncratic characters to make it positively irresistible.

O&#x2019;Connor&#x2019;s protagonists are rendered via scrupulously researched scenes of their lives in Paris and at Monticello that alternate with a harrowing memoir written by Hemings after Jefferson&#x2019;s death, as well as with dreamlike sequences in which Jefferson watches a movie about his life, Hemings fabricates an "invention" that becomes the whole world, and they run into each other "after an unimaginable length of time" on the New York City subway. O'Connor is unsparing in his rendition of the hypocrisy of the Founding Father and slaveholder who wrote "all men are created equal,&#x201d; while enabling Hemings to tell her story in a way history has not allowed her to. His important and beautifully written novel is a deep moral reckoning, a story about the search for justice, freedom and an ideal world&#x2014;and about the survival of hope even in the midst of catastrophe.</p><p>Stephen O'Connor is the author of two collections of short fiction, <i>Here Comes Another Lesson</i> and <i>Rescue</i>, as well as <i>Orphan Trains</i>, an acclaimed history of a pioneering nineteenth-century child welfare effort, and <i>Will My Name Be Shouted Out</i>, a memoir. His fiction has appeared in many publications, including <i>The New Yorker</i> and <i>The Best American Short Stories</i>.

O&#x2019;Connor&#x2019;s deeply humane treatment of Sally, whose actual thoughts will never be known to us, is the novel&#x2019;s most haunting accomplishment. Ultimately, this is a book in vigorous debate with itself, as strange and contradictory as the author of the Declaration of Independence. With its magically engineered collection of fiction, history, and fantasy, and particularly with its own capacious spirit, <i>Thomas Jefferson Dreams of Sally Hemings</i> doesn&#x2019;t just knock Jefferson off his pedestal, it blows us over, too, shatters the whole sinner-saint debate and clears out new room to reconsider these two impossibly different people who once gave birth to the United States. It&#x2019;s heartbreaking. It&#x2019;s cathartic. It&#x2019;s utterly brilliant.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Ron Charles, <i>The Washington Post</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;In hundreds of brief, pointillist chapters, Mr. O&#x2019;Connor reimagines their decades-long relationship . . . The effect is prismatic and utterly arresting&nbsp; . . . Hemings is the novel&#x2019;s outstanding character, eloquent and capable, morally exacting and self-aware, now overflowing with tenderness, now seething with hatred. Jefferson cuts a far more ambivalent figure, unmatched in intelligence but often paralyzed by guilt.&#x201d;<br><b><i>&#x2014;The Wall Street Journal<br></i></b><br>&#x201c;Ambitious doesn't begin to describe the scope of the project O'Connor undertook. And successful doesn't begin to describe the wildly imaginative techniques he used to realize his authorial goal, which is clearly to humanize &#x2014; equalize, you might say &#x2014; the two members of this passionate, conflicted couple . . . What makes these literary gymnastics work is, in a word, talent . . . What justifies the risk is his insistence on using a full palette and tiny brushes to draw these characters, rejecting broad brush strokes in black and white.

It&#x2019;s also a superb argument for why we do this imagining &#x2014; in the novel&#x2019;s wilder moments where O&#x2019;Connor weaves Jefferson into the present day, he underscores how hard it is to untangle slavery from the American conversation.&#x201d;<br><b><i><i>&#x2014;</i>The Minneapolis Star Tribune</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[F]ully acknowledging the tragedy of slavery, O'Connor produces a tale that is overflowing with the range of human emotion; in its depiction of feeling, the novel is often brilliant, dense in poetry and light on unearned sentimentality.&#x201d; <br><b><b>&#x2014;</b>Kirkus Reviews</b><br><br>&#x201c;O&#x2019;Connor is a brave writer.

Its format is impressively inventive and accessible, and it suits its subject.&nbsp; Using traditional narrative, dream sequences, reimaginings, and excerpts from memoirs and Jefferson&#x2019;s writings, it moves beyond historical fiction to demonstrate the bitter, long-lasting aftereffects of Jefferson&#x2019;s moral hypocrisy. . . .this mind-expanding epic offers much to discuss.&#x201d;<br><b><i>&#x2014;ALA Booklist</i> (starred)</b><br><br>&#x201c;By turns delicate and luminous, then searing and straightforward, Stephen O&#x2019;Connor&#x2019;s novel sings &#x2013; it is an epic dream and an epic read.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally Hemings and Thomas Jefferson come alive in this book, beautifully imagined, and so well-rendered that they become achingly human.&#x201d; <br><b>&#x2014;Jesmyn Ward, National Book Award-winning author of <i>Salvage the Bones</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A brilliant, huge-hearted act of the moral imagination.

Unlike some other Confederate memoirists, General Edward Porter Alexander had no use for bitter Lost Cause&#x201d; theories to explain the South&#x2019;s defeat. Alexander was willing to objectively evaluate and criticize prominent Confederate officers, including Robert E. Lee. The result is a clear-eyed assessment of the long, bloody conflict that forged a nation.<br><br>The memoir opens with Alexander, recently graduated from West Point, heading to Utah to tamp down the hostile actions of Mormons who had refused to receive a territorial governor appointed by President Buchanan. A few years later, Alexander finds himself on the opposite side of a much larger rebellion this time aligned with Confederates bent on secession from the Union. In the years that follow, he is involved in most of the major battles of the East, including Manassas, Antietam, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, and Chickamauga. Alexander describes each battle and battlefield in sharp detail.<br><br>Few wartime narratives offer the insight and objectivity of Alexander&#x2019;s <i> Military Memoirs of a Confederate </i>.

Lee&#x2019;s artillery commander for most of the Civil War. After the Confederate surrender, he served as an executive at various railroad companies and became a respected author. He died in Savannah, Georgia.This book was published in 1907 and immediately recognized as a classic. Unlike &#39;Fighting for the Confederacy, &#39; which was based largely on Alexander&#39;s own recollections, &#39;Military Memoirs of a Confederate&#39; relies on a vast amount of research.

In this pungent if impersonal memoir, the noted historian, raised in a family of Jews who converted to Christianity, looks back through a glass darkly. He recalls Berlin of the 1920s; turbulent years of revolution and civil war that hardly touched his bourgeois world. The lengthening shadow cast by Nazism is evoked through a series of letters reprinted here. Bleak, atmospheric chapters cover his exile in London where he arrived in 1933 and remained during the later German bombings. As an American officer in 1945, Gilbert was a member of the mission that determined the boundary lines that still divide Germany today. In measured prose he weighs the past against the present, linking his personal sense of dislocation to the ruptures of history. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Stitch and Structure: Design and Technique in Two- and Three-Dimensional Textiles</h2><p>Textile artists eager to expand their repertoire into two- and three-dimensional work will find this an essential and inspiring reference.

That information has been presented in a variety of ways over the decades, usually focusing on a particular site, individual, or theme. Reeves (The Complete Tutankhamun, The Complete Valley of the Kings) reverses the approach, presenting a chronological look at the discoveries. Each chapter considers a different event. Some, like the discovery of the Rosetta Stone and of Tutankhamun's tomb, are spectacular. Others, from the Harris Papyri to Kufu's solar boats found buried beside the great pyramid, are less well remembered but still important for the critical information that they reveal. The stories behind the discoveries are as fascinating as the objects uncovered. In the end, Reeves presents a wonderful panorama of the history of Egyptology. Not since Barbara Mertz's Temples, Tombs and Hieroglyphs (1964. o.p.) has the history of Egyptology been so well reported. Unlike Mertz's highly entertaining but informal discussion, Reeves's sets out information on both Egyptologists and their discoveries in a very clear, understandable, and well-illustrated way. Not just a reference bookDalthough its extensive time lines, charts, bibliography, and notes will be very useful for quick reference or as a touchstone for researchDthis is also a delightful book to browse, sample, and return to.

Those who understand warfare from research or from personal experience generally realize this about the conflicts that have plagued mankind since the dawn of time. Infantry weapons&#x2014;often referred to as small arms&#x2014;have fascinated soldiers and scholars for decades as they are the most personal aspects of combat. Small arms come into play when contact is close and potentially lethal. This was particularly true during the long, frustrating war in Vietnam, but much of the focus in studying that conflict has been either on aerial weapons&#x2014;strike aircraft or armed helicopters&#x2014;or on the originally much-maligned M16 rifle. There were huge numbers of other weapons used by both sides, but they are often ignored and rarely seen being used in combat action. This book solves that problem. Divided into easily digestible sections and preceded by cogent discussions of each weapon type, the authors have presented an intriguing collection of photographs that depict the primary small (and not so small) infantry arms most common on Vietnam battlefields. There are rare and stirring images here that depict what it was like to fight in the jungle-covered mountains and in the rice paddies. Viewing these images is like studying a primer about one of America&#x2019;s longest and deadliest wars.</p><p>DALE DYE IS a Marine officer who rose through the ranks to retire as a Captain after 21 years of service in war and peace. He is a distinguished graduate of Missouri Military Academy who en-listed in the United States Marine Corps shortly after graduation. Sent to war in Southeast Asia, he served in Vietnam in 1965 and 1967 through 1970 surviving 31 major combat operations. Appointed a Warrant Officer in 1976, he later converted his commission and was a Captain when he deployed to Beirut, Lebanon with the Multinational Force in 1982-83. He served in a variety of assignments around the world and along the way attained a degree in English Literature from the University of Maryland. Following retirement from active duty in 1984, he spent time in Central America, reporting and training troops for guerrilla warfare in El Salvador, Honduras and Costa Rica. Upset with Hollywood&#x2019;s treatment of the American military, he went to Hollywood and established Warriors Inc., the preeminent military training and advisory service to the entertainment industry. He has worked on more than 50 movies and TV shows including several Academy Award and Emmy winning productions. He is a novelist, actor, director and show business innovator, who wanders between Los Angeles and Lockhart, Texas. The son of a US 8th Infantry Division veteran who fought in Normandy, Brittany and Germany, Tom Laemlein has always been fascinated by weaponry. However, it wasn't until his thirties that he purchased his first carbine which was the start of his collecting career. It also set him on his path as a publisher of specialist titles aimed at weapon collectors and enthusiasts through the creation of Armor Plate Press. His most recent publishing successes have included the highly successful American Firepower Series.<p>"We have a new generation of combat veterans among us these days.

Since the early 1980s, Thomas Ruff has created a substantial photographic oeuvre in which he draws our attention to all of these familiar subjects, simultaneously marshalling a precise, fascinating rendition of our perceptual universe and a conceptually matter-of-fact presentation of untold layers of meaning and photographic premises.

This brand new book begins with a look at the history of Athens and the Acropolis. Starting at prehistoric times, this historical overview describes the town&#39;s development, from a quite modest Mycenaean settlement to one of the most powerful city-states of the classical era, the one that gave birth to democracy and theatre, and then its downfall to a small, provincial fortified town of the Byzantine Empire. At the same time, the reader can follow the historical steps of the Acropolis itself, originally a fort, which was transformed to the most glamorous shrine of the city, only to become a fort again, after the end of the ancient world. Then, there is a short account of the Athenian myths, especially the ones concerning the town&#39;s patron deity, Athena. After discovering the exciting past of the town and the sacred rock, the reader will get to know the temples, buildings in general, that were constructed at the top of the Acropolis during the archaic and classical era of Greece. Parthenon, the masterpiece of Pheidias, Iktinos and Kallikratis is, of course, the highlight, but there were other important and architecturally innovative structures there, such as the Propylaea and the Erechtheion. This part of the book gives a very good idea of how the ancient hill looked, with all its buildings and its uncountable offerings: statues that ancient Athenians were bringing to their goddess Athena as a present. Then, the reader will have the chance to learn everything about the very important south slope of the Acropolis, with the famous theatre of Dionysus, and enjoy an imaginary walk at the north and east slopes of the ancient rock. The second part of the book is devoted to the admittedly impressive new Acropolis Museum. The reader can &#34;navigate&#34; through the different levels of the museum exhibition, using the book as a guide which gives interesting information and highlights the most important exhibits. &#34;Moschoforos&#34;, the Kore of the Acropolis, the Caryatids, Parthenon&#39;s frieze are only a few of the ancient pieces of art that this book presents, through captivating pictures and texts. In conclusion, The Acropolis, the New Acropolis Museum is a valuable reading for all those who want to explore and understand one of the major archaeological sites of the world and it&#39;s brand new Museum.

Rather, they show us a man of reason, conscience, common sense, and love. Whether addressing his professional peers (academic economists) with scholarly scrupulousness, speaking frankly to social activists, or recounting his own experiences of racial oppression and Christian rebirth, Loury affirms only what he has found by research, action, or careful reflection to be true. Writing on black-Jewish relations, black victimization as a social identity, economic inequities, modern liberalism and racism, and his other primary topics in this book, he is cogent because of his analytic ability (best displayed in a theoretical article on political correctness), compelling because of the intelligence with which he argues for acknowledging religion as a force in public affairs and personal behavior in order to successfully deal with the problems of racism and poverty. Loury's work expresses some of the very best thinking about race in the U.S. <i>Ray Olson</i>Loury, a prominent black neoconservative, is at his best in this collection as a critic, ably confronting authors such as Cornel West ("sloganeering"), Andrew Hacker ("conspiracy theory") and Derrick Bell ("opinion in the guise of a morality tale.") His more substantive essays make a few worthwhile, if not new, points: blacks should avoid one-note politics, and they too often embrace victimhood. Though Loury shows concern for the black poor, his vague solution of self-help?"religious, civic, and voluntary efforts of all sorts"?is sloganeering that should be fleshed out by reportage and analysis. In an epilogue Loury recounts?somewhat gingerly, given his professorial emphasis on personal morality?his "born again" spiritual journey, which rescued him from his own descent into drug and alcohol dependence. He now teaches economics at Boston University. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Trail of Cthulhu</h2><p>No one but August Derleth could continue the Cthulhu Mythos cycle after the death of its creator, his friend H.P.

Kevin Dann emulates and extends Thoreau's experiment in radical self-education. Alternating between personal anecdotes from his spring 2017 walking pilgrimage and other "traveler" encounters and episodes told by Thoreau, Dann structures his book around 12 "injunctions"--distillations of seminal stories about overcoming convention and stasis. In this essential reading for every Thoreau enthusiast, naturalist and historian Kevin Dann brings to life an essential American icon in refreshing and modern way.</p><p>Historian, naturalist, and troubadour Kevin Dann is the acclaimed author of <i>Expect Great Things: The Life and Search of Henry David Thoreau</i>, and books including<i> Across the Great Border Fault: The Naturalist Myth in America and Lewis Creek Lost and Found</i>.

In the spring of 2009, he walked from Montreal to Manhattan to commemorate the 400th anniversaries of Hudson's and Champlain's voyages, and, having crossed the Brooklyn Bridge, decided to make his home there.Chapter 1<br><br>Up Broadway: AWAKE!<br><br>Surely Henry David Thoreau was the most incongruous pedestrian who ever trod lower Broadway. In the fall of 1843, Thoreau had come to Staten Island to serve as tutor to the children of Ralph Waldo Emerson's brother William. He was still a year and a half away from his radical remove from Concord Village out to his homely cabin on the south shore of Walden Pond, yet he had plenty of contrarian critique of this world-renowned avenue of luxury. At P. T. Barnum's American Museum, which faced both St. Paul's Chapel and America's premier luxury hotel, the Astor House, Thoreau was treated to a kind of proto-Disneyland, a spectacular simulacrum of adolescent American fantasies of exoticism, cheap titillation, and vicarious adventure. Writing to Ralph Waldo Emerson but a week or two after his arrival, Thoreau described a cartoon canoe race on the Hudson between "Chippeway" Indians and straw-boater-topped Gothamites. The farce was almost as foolish as the "buffalo hunt" Barnum staged across the river in Hoboken. The showman's "free" spectacles (Barnum was collecting a considerable cut of the ferry fares) were the real sideshows, thought Thoreau: "Canoes and buffaloes are lost, as is everything here, in the mob." Encountering hordes of immigrants going up Broadway from Castle Garden, whole families cooking their dinner on the pavements, Concord's vagrant philosopher had hoped that they might preserve their individuality in this New World: "It must have a very bad influence to see so many human beings at once-mere herds of men."<br><br>On the first day of the spring of 2017, padding that same pavement in my well-worn walking shoes, it was hard not to weep bitter tears over Henry's nearly two-century-old lament. In the place of hoe-toting Norwegians and sunburned Irish and Italians there were clustered around the voluptuous bronze Charging Bull adjacent to Broadway's Bowling Green hundreds of selfie-snapping tourists, jockeying round its Taurean testicles at one end, its flaming vampire squid Wall Street nostrils at the other. A thousand portraits an hour uploaded to Instagram and Facebook and WeChat might serve as symbol as well as any other contemporary symptoms of a profound and troubling somnambulism at Broadway's foot and across America and the whole world.<br><br>That antebellum autumn on Staten Island, Thoreau was himself suffering from an acute episode of somnambulism; his sleep was literally interrupted by the "family curse" of sleeplessness. For the wide-awake Thoreau, it merely doubled his resolve to rise alert and aware, and to champion to his neighbors the benefits of being wide awake. Of all Henry's "excursions"-in that classic sense of deviating from a direct course-in those years leading up to his two-year Walden Pond experiment in living, the New York City sojourn most directly inspired his embrace of his most famous mantra: Simplify. Simplify. SoHo's spring 2017 shop windows have nothing on A. T. Stewart's Marble Palace, a block north of City Hall, and a long line of luxury-laden Broadway arcade windows in autumn 1843. Just blocks off Broadway, Henry's pavement-pounding manuscript peddling had finally found its mark, with John L. O'Sullivan, who published Thoreau's essay "Paradise (To Be) Regained" in his United States Magazine and Democratic Review. The piece was more than a savaging of J. A. Etzler's 1842 technotopian book The Paradise within the Reach of All Men, without Labor, by Powers of Nature and Machinery; it was a prophetic plea for America to bring an inner "motive power" equal to its outer one: "There is a certain divine energy in every man, but sparingly employed as yet, which may be called the crank within-the crank after all,-the prime mover in all machinery-quite indispensable to all work. Would that we might get our hands on its handle!"<br><br>Today that sublime and secret handle seems more elusive than ever. The "crank" of nearly all human endeavor reduced to the tip of one's index finger, the arcade window shrunk now to the size of an index card, we universally worship at the altar of menu consciousness, our relentless expectation of Heaven on Earth now supremely satisfied by the hidden magic of the silicon chip behind a slick glass screen. It is perhaps too obvious to point out that we have fallen far from the $28.12 cents' worth of boards, lath, old brick, casks of lime, iron nails, hinges, and screws of Henry's Walden cabin, or the $8.7 cents he spent for provisions he consumed (all else he raised himself) in his two-year residence at the pond. We all sense that we are awash in a tide of luxury, an ersatz "Paradise" that makes Hurricane Sandy's storm surge seem trifling. America is drowning in its own prodigious prodigality, inundated by "Broadway," estranged from Walden Pond, and Walden.<br><br>5<br><br>Throughout the summer and fall of 2017 the Cathedral of Commerce-the Woolworth Building-was wearing a black shroud upon her crown, as her upper floors were converted from office space to luxury apartments. Alchemy Properties hired Thierry Despont, the architect who oversaw the conversion of the Ritz Paris, for the job. While one-bedrooms can be had for as little as $4.5 million, and whole-floor spreads for $26.5 million, the seven-story penthouse will run you $110 million or so. Even F. W. Woolworth, the five-and-dime department store magnate who built this tallest-in-the-world office tower in 1913 with cold cash, would not be able to come up with that kind of money.<br><br>From the glorious Gothic entrance and from the east-facing windows of every one of those new palatial apartments, as one looks just slightly north to City Hall, one sees Manhattan's most understated monument to the American Revolution. The top of the City Hall flagpole is crowned with a gold weather vane bearing the simple word liberty. It is no vague slogan, but a faithful remembrance of the Liberty Poles erected upon this once-English common, where King George III's soldiers were quartered in barracks that stood just about where the Tweed Courthouse stands today.<br><br>In my mind's eye, I always see a gang of red-capped Gotham teenagers raising those stolen British navy masts in the middle of the night, silently counting coup against the Crown with the scarlet liberty flag that flew from its spire. I imagine most of those Liberty Boys as seventeen-my age when I read Walden for the first time. Passing it on this March 20, I am reminded that it was March 21, 1769, when the British army chopped the Liberty Pole down after that month's Stamp Act repeal celebrations. The next time the Liberty Boys put up a pole on the common, they sheathed it in iron to stop the British soldiers' axes; the commemorative flagpole is similarly sheathed.<br><br>Though you can't now see the spot from Broadway's sidewalk, it was just two blocks from here that the "First Blood" of the American Revolution was spilled, six weeks before the Boston Massacre. Redcoats attacked a group of citizens defending the Liberty Pole raised in the Golden Hill wheat field-about where the John Street Church stands today. Francis Field, an innocent bystander, was slashed in the face by a British bayonet as he stepped out to see what the ruckus was. A peddler and fisherman were injured, and another man took a near-fatal bayonet stab in his chest.<br><br>F. W. Woolworth might rightly say that New York City, and America with it, has nickled-and-dimed its way from the courageous spirit of the Sons of Liberty to our current cowardly, craven posture of luxury. Our national obsession with luxury stands starkly caricatured before all the world in the person of one of Gotham's native sons, whom American citizens freely placed in the highest office of the land. That the nation's first president humbly walked from Federal Hall on Wall Street, up Broadway to a service at St. Paul's Chapel-a block south of the Woolworth Building-after his inauguration goes unremembered and uncelebrated, while ten thousand tourists a day stream under the golden threshold of this or that Trump Tower, sleepwalking to the deadly drumbeat of the American cult of celebrity.<br><br>Born a stone's throw from where the "shot heard round the world" was fired, Henry Thoreau never for a moment forgot that the price of liberty was eternal vigilance. Only five years before his birth, Concord's citizens, including his father, had fought a second war for independence against that empire of luxury-Great Britain. Those who had taken part in the events had tutored Henry and other Concord children in tales of the Revolution. He heard from his mother's mother that after her Tory brothers had been arrested, she had smuggled metal files to them in the Concord jail. An elderly neighbor told Thoreau how her brother, the morning after the famous battle, had come home to fetch cider and cheese for himself and his fellow Minutemen. That the Battle's of Lexington and Concord were known by all Thoreau's neighbors as simply the "Concord Fight" attests to the degree to which this mythic event was engraved into both the local landscape and the folk soul. That he began his Walden Pond vigil on the Fourth of July was the simplest and most obvious of his often obscure choices.<br><br>Manhattan's role as American cultural capital tends to erase local myth and legend in favor of the national. The sidewalk of lower Broadway is punctuated with 206 granite flagstones commemorating ticker-tape parades from the Battery to City Hall Park. In the wake of the first ticker-tape parade celebrating returning World War I soldiers, the ritual quickly devolved into imperial posturing, from the 1924 parade for the American Olympic team to Charles Lindbergh's triumphal transatlantic flight in 1927, and then, from 1945 to 1965, 130 parades to welcome foreign heads of state. In 1969, John Lindsay threw a parade for the Mets! The city's "Canyon of Heroes" conveniently obliterates Broadway's august history of rambunctious street rebellions-beginning with the July 9, 1776, parade from the Commons down to Bowling Green to tear down the gilt equestrian statue of King George III after the first public reading in New York of the Declaration of Independence. Such truly heroic local events are in danger of disappearing completely from living memory. It is sobering to think that as recently as 1899, New York City's most celebrated monument was the flagpole at Battery Park, up which John van Arsdale-who had enlisted as a sailor at age nineteen-had shimmied on the twenty-fifth of November 1783, to replace the Union Jack with the American flag. As General George Washington and his troops paraded down Broadway, the street filled with New Yorkers celebrating the end of seven years of British occupation.<br><br>"Luxury," "extravagance," "false refinements" were the bywords of Revolutionary rhetoric, linked inextricably to British tyranny. Even as the Woolworth Building was raised up on Broadway, to a man its builders-masons, carpenters, steelworkers, and sculptors-knew the tale of John van Arsdale and the Battery Park flagpole. Stand on the sidewalk today, at quitting time on any weekday afternoon, and ask the guys with hard hats what New York's most heartily celebrated holiday was for the first century after American independence. Not a soul can answer Evacuation Day-November 25. But most will freely guess how much Donald Trump is worth.<br><br>5<br><br>My notion-like Henry�s-was to walk deliberately, to �front only the essential facts of life� as I headed out toward Concord, and so my goal on that first day of spring was to lay my head down on the earth inside one of the Indian caves up in Inwood Hill Park that evening. Having walked and bicycled Broadway�s length dozens of times, I had no doubt I�d reach my destination by midafternoon, immune to any of Broadway�s delicious distractions. Union Square, Madison Square, Herald Square, Times Square, Columbus Circle-not one of the eccentric agoras kept me from my steadfast allegiance to walk upstream, to feel the invisible rush of energy that comes when one walks north against the southward-streaming traffic. Though the prevailing wind on Mannahatta is from the south, any wide-awake body takes immediate note of a more palpable current from the north, a track laid down in the ether by ten thousand years of moccasined feet and a couple of centuries of pedestrians, peddlers� carts, streetcars, and automobiles. Like walking or running in the woods when the trees press close along the path, that current imparts vigor and vitality, an electricity wholly hygienic in contrast to the neon and LCD emanations of Times and other Broadway squares.<br><br>I pass a thousand moments of my own biography as I walk north, each one bringing a small pulse of gratitude for the deep mystery that is life. And then, up at 166th Street, I am stopped dead in my tracks. NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center is a massive, beige brick, postwar building-really four buildings all on top of one another. Somewhere up among those anonymous windows, on March 25, 1956, I was born. I wondered how my mother could have abided such a monstrous edifice as the place to welcome her firstborn. In the space of sixty seconds, three different emergency vehicles screamed up to the hospital's entrance. I retreated across Broadway to a little green sanctuary called Mitchell Square.<br><br>A thin sliver of land wedged between Broadway's wide swath and St. Nicholas Avenue, with only a half dozen benches and no other amenities, this park seems more orphaned than my imagination of all the babies born across the street. There is only a single London plane tree, half a dozen Callery pears, and a misshapen locust at its northern end where the park comes to a narrow point. A glacially smoothed bit of bedrock, big enough for a ball team to sit on, crops out right smack-dab in the center of the park. I stepped up to this humble summit of schist, faced south toward the sun, closed my eyes, and recalled words spoken by Joan of Arc, as she confronted her difficult destiny six centuries ago.<br><br>"I was born to do this. May God keep me here. I act, so that God will act." I've long forgotten where I first heard Joan's three-part prayer and pledge; most likely it was from Mark Twain's Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc, his 1896 serialized novel, which he had published anonymously in order to free his readers from hearing it in his renowned comic satirical voice. There seemed in Twain's relationship to Joan something of the singularity of destiny that marked her extraordinary life. One day in 1849, while the thirteen-year-old Sam Clemens was working as a printer's devil (an apprentice who performed a number of tasks) in Hannibal, Missouri, a gust of wind blew a stray leaf from a book across his path. Picking it up, he discovered that it described the persecution in prison by rough English soldiers of a person called "Joan of Arc"; on this single page he read the story of how the soldiers had stolen her clothes. Sam hurried home and asked his mother and older brother if Joan of Arc was a real person, and learned that she had been a young French peasant girl who had saved her nation from English tyranny. He would on occasion tell this story as the turning point of his life; indeed, from the moment of finding that tumbling page on that Hannibal street, the worlds of both history and literature opened up to young Samuel Clemens, and, though history has largely neutralized his radicalism, he became a fiery crusader for justice. Twain seemed to be drawn to Joan's story because he saw it as the epitome of the age-old struggle of the common folk against political and religious oppression by those more powerful. Twain's story of Joan of Arc affirmed the value of a spiritual life at a moment when his culture was madly pursuing a path of industrialism, imperialism, and materialism.</p><h2>Refuge (Issac Asimov&#39;s Robot City, No. 5)</h2><p>A man without memory, in a city of robots gone wild.

In this study of the miracles of Jesus, Graham Twelftree extensively examines the miracles within each Gospel narrative. He evaluates Jesus' own understanding of the miracles, weighs the historical reliability of the miracle stories, and considers the question of miracles and the modern mind. This book maps and explores the borderlands between the affirmations of faith and the conclusions of historical method. Are some miracles simply more open to historical verification than others? With the historical study of Jesus once again capturing the attention of the media and the public, this timely book courageously steps forward to investigate the hard questions. <em>Jesus the Miracle Worker</em> is a comprehensive and textbook study of the miracles of Jesus, written by a recognized expert in the historical investigation of the exorcisms of Jesus.</p><p>Graham H. Twelftree (Ph.D., University of Nottingham) is Distinguished Professor of New Testament at Regent University in Virginia Beach, Virginia. He is the author of numerous books, including <em>Christ Triumphant</em> and <em>Jesus the Exorcist.</em><p>"This fine study of the miracle traditions in the Gospels faces squarely the awkward philosophical and historical questions."</p><p>Graham N.

Kaffe Fassett is a delightful exception. Indeed, the text of <i>Glorious Interiors</i> is something rare in interior design: a down-to-earth account of a complex and sophisticated personal style. Drawing inspiration from circuses, fairgrounds, the Watts Towers in Los Angeles, the liveries of Pakistani trucks, and Slavic peasant costume, Fassett dedicates his book to "all those with a touch of gypsy who share my vision." Going by the vibrant kitsch, the obsessive repetition, and the migrainous, fractal surfaces of his trademark interiors, one suspects that not a few of them have ended up, tragically, in decidedly minimal circumstances, complete with soft white walls and bars on the windows.<p> Fassett's embroidered flower gardens, frog cushions, trompe l'oeil flower plates, and postage-stamp lampshades teeter spectacularly on the knife's edge separating genius from schizophrenia; his text, meanwhile, really makes the reader think--in a way few other books have ever done--about the emotional power of the richly patterned traditions of eastern Europe and the Indian subcontinent. Fassett contends that Western interiors--the best of them evoking "a sterile beigeness ... that chilled me to the core"--have lost all sense of humor. And he knows just what we need to get it back. </p><p> <i>Glorious Interiors</i> is full of lengthy, meticulous instructions for jaw-dropping rag rugs, collage screens, mosaics, and many other pieces. Whether inspiring you or scaring you half to death, Fassett is one interior designer it is impossible to ignore. <i>--Simon Ings, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>Textile artist/designer Kaffe Fassett's passions are color and pattern: color upon color?dozens in one piece?and pattern upon pattern?always something new for the eye to feast on. Here he shows the reader eight different rooms in his own home, each with its own color scheme and each built around a central idea or motif such as shells, leaves, mosaics, and flowers. The rag rugs, pillows, screens, and throws designed to populate those rooms will be major projects for most needleworkers, but the actual techniques utilized are simple enough to put all projects within reach of the motivated beginner. Fassett offers instruction, charts, and color photographs for some 31 projects?including valuable techniques for working with many colors in the same project?and also serves up a brief chapter on needlecraft techniques. Libraries that have any of Fassett's other "glorious" books (e.g., Glorious Knits, LJ 1/86) will want to add this title. Highly recommended.?Janice Zlendich, California State Univ.

This&nbsp;funny picture book about the strong-willed dog who really doesn't want a bath stands the test of time.</strong></p><p>Harry is a white dog with black spots who absolutely, positively hates to take a bath. After a day of adventure, Harry gets so dirty that he no longer looks like a white dog with black spots. Now he looks like a black dog with white spots! </p><p><em>Harry the Dirty Dog</em> has become a classic, entertaining young readers for decades. Perfect for young fans of dogs...especially ones who also don't always want a bath!</p><p>For more fun with Harry the Dirty Dog, don't miss <em>No Roses for Harry!</em> and&nbsp;<em>Harry and the Lady Next Door. </em>As<em> Children's Books and Their Creators </em>said about all three books: "There is a droll, seemingly effortless union of art and text in the Harry stories, a delicious mastery of everyday foolishness."</p></p><p>"Harry was a white dog with black spots who liked everything, except getting a bath." Taking matters into his own paws, he buries his family's scrubbing brush in the backyard and runs away from home before they can wrangle him into the tub. Harry gets dirty playing in the street, dirtier at the railroad, and dirtier still playing tag with the other dogs. When sliding down the coal chute, he actually changes from a white dog with black spots to a black dog with white spots! Of course, by the time he gets home he is completely unrecognizable to his family--even when he does all his clever flip-flopping tricks. In a stroke of doggy genius, he unearths the bath brush, begs for a bath, and the rest is history. Youngsters will completely relate to the urge to rebel, the thrill of getting dirty, and, finally, the reassurance of family.

It is also a book about the often amusing and sometimes painful counterpoint between worldliness and holiness in Isherwood's own life. Sexual sprees, all-night drinking bouts, a fast car ride with Greta Garbo, script-writing conferences at M-G-M, and intellectual sparring sessions with Bertolt Brecht alternated with nights of fasting at the Vedanta Center and a six-month period of celibacy and sobriety.

Potter of the 57th New York</h2><p>On March 23, 1888, Doctor William Warren Potter wrote, "It is expedient that every man who can do so, should record what he did, and what he saw done, during his military service. Acting upon this conviction, I have attempted to carry out this purpose in my own case in a truthful manner, without any attempt at self-praise, or to embellish the pages with anecdote or eulogy." Potter, who served as the assistant surgeon of the 49th New York, and as the surgeon of the 57th New York, left behind an account of the war from a doctor's perspective.<br>He documents the history of the 49th New York from its creation in August 1861 through Fredericksburg, when he transferred to the 57th New York. From there his accounts follow the events through Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, the Wilderness, Petersburg, and Deep Bottom. Potter gives the reader an intimate view of the War from a surgeon's perspective.

I had never heard of it before now.&nbsp; Later, when I finally tell others about this moment, they simply cannot believe that that movie could have snuck up on me the way it did. At the time, however, it was not so unusual: I was a graduate student in film studies, yes, but my interest was in postwar melodramas of the 1950s. Imitation of Life, Magnificent Obsession. New releases rarely caught my attention. From what I gathered by the way Bobby carried on, this one was a scary movie, a real doozy&#x2014; well outside the bounds of my expertise. &#x201c;Creepy stuff,&#x201d; he was saying to Cheryl, another officemate of mine.</p><p>The three of us shared a windowless space on the third floor of the English Department at a Midwestern university&#x2014;one I&#x2019;ll refrain from naming because it hardly matters for my story. The office was barely big enough for our three desks. Each one was shoved against a different wall, mine beside the community filing cabinet. Normally, the office cleared out for the weekends. So this morning I had been surprised&#x2014;and mildly annoyed&#x2014;to find Cheryl at her desk, that carrot-colored hair of hers all bunched up behind her head in a scrunchie. She quietly paged through several books, making notes, never once turning around to bother me. Then Bobby showed up and ruined it.</p><p>Together they made a genuine commotion. Bobby wanted to pull up the movie trailer on YouTube to show her what he was talking about, his beefy fingers clicking along her laptop&#x2019;s keyboard. I fumed. I was going to ask them to use headphones to watch the trailer, but Bobby pressed play before I could speak, and a voice from across the room&#x2014;not mention from across space and time and even death&#x2014;rang out from the laptop&#x2019;s speakers. Acoustic, bare: &#x201c;Beulah Land,&#x201d; the voice sang. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m longing for you.&#x201d;</p><p>My skin prickled at the sound of her voice, with the memory of old sores long since healed. On the wall above my desk, several post- cards were thumbtacked to a cork board by a grad student before my time. Brazil, Laos, Amsterdam. A god&#x2019;s-eye view of the cities: their winding roads and closely packed buildings, each snapshot taunting me with elsewhere. The song continued on, infecting the air. Her voice, Mother Maude&#x2019;s, like a slap. The office, the camp&#x2014; they collapsed into one. The stink of Lake John. The other boys shouting, louder than hell. <i>Lord</i>, they cried, <i>burn me a new!</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the summer of 1999, when I was fifteen years old, I spent almost four weeks at a camp that was supposed to cure me of my homosexuality. Though I changed in many ways at Camp Levi, my desires&#x2014;to the grief of everyone involved&#x2014;did not. The campgrounds were located in central Mississippi on a rural spit of hinterland called the Neck, two and half hours south of the Delta, where I grew up. Camp Levi wasn&#x2019;t affiliated with any particular Christian denomination. The founders, Mother Maude and Father Drake, had ties to churches of all kinds, each of them instrumental in helping raise the money to pilot the program, including the church where my father was once the pastor. Before she started the camp, Mother Maude enjoyed a short-lived career as a gospel singer that ran out of steam sometime before her twin brother (and former manager) contracted AIDS. After his death, she vowed to save other boys from a similar fate, and so the idea for the camp was born.</p><p>Her cover of &#x201c;Beulah Land,&#x201d; popular on Christian radio in the mid-1980s, accompanied the movie trailer playing on Cheryl&#x2019;s lap- top. There was no voice-over. Only clips from the movie, which I couldn&#x2019;t stomach looking at, and Mother Maude&#x2019;s weepy voice, which I couldn&#x2019;t escape. Before the song finished, I slid under my desk. I was small enough to fold my body into the leg space down there and still have enough room left over to pull my rolling chair up to my chest and rest my face, cheek down, on the warm cushioned seat. Bobby and Cheryl never even noticed. After the trailer ended, they were silent. Their bodies leaned into each other, the way lovers do, forming a kind of triangle. Their affair was a secret. I&#x2019;d discovered it, without even trying, months ago simply by reading this kind of body language. I always forgot the reason it was such a scandal for them to be sleeping together. One or the other was married, but I couldn&#x2019;t remember who. Cheryl was the first to speak: &#x201c;Wow,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;That was&#x2014;just wow.&#x201d; Bobby followed by condemning the South: &#x201c;It&#x2019;s fucked up, all of it. Those people.&#x201d; His pronouncement was enough to settle the matter between them. They changed the subject, and he asked if she was hungry. &#x201c;Always,&#x201d; Cheryl told him, her voice low and vaguely suggestive, while on the other side of the room, hiding under my desk, I was biting my lip to keep from screaming. They debated possible restaurants, agreeing on Mexican. &#x201c;Is this the one with the good fried ice cream?&#x201d; Bobby asked, as they passed my desk. They killed the lights, locking the door be- hind them.</p><p>When I returned home from the camp, I had trouble with the details of what had happened to me. They were slippery things, made of water. Even when I testified at the trial, I struggled to answer definitively the lawyers&#x2019; questions. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t recall,&#x201d; I&#x2019;d say, until the judge interrupted me, and said, not unkindly, &#x201c;Son, can&#x2019;t or won&#x2019;t?&#x201d; Only later did particulars resurface. The first time was when I was moving from Vanderbilt to where I live now. I had driven for most of the day and stopped off at a Comfort Inn. I lay in bed, the AC unit turned up as high as it would go, the curtains closed. As I drifted, I heard the chant we boys used to holler before jumping into the lake: &#x201c;Lord, rend my flesh! Lord, burn me anew!&#x201d; I sprang up from the mattress. I checked the closet, looked outside my window and down the hallway. Nothing. And that was the terrible part: the silence that followed. The silence that proved you were crazy all along. Some- times there were only voices. I&#x2019;d be reading, making dinner, bathing, and snippets of conversation from that summer would float by as if coming from a television set that was left on in another room. But sometimes it was worse. The voices grew into memory, and the mem- ory gathered itself into muscle and bone. Into Father Drake&#x2019;s hands clasped around my neck, pushing me against the Sweat Shack. Into Mother Maude&#x2019;s terrible embrace, holding me until the others found me. I&#x2019;d get the shakes then and break into a cold sweat. One time, in a graduate class, a professor saw me in the thrall of one of these spells and, thinking I was a diabetic, sent another classmate off to the vending machine to fetch me a pack of Skittles.</p><p>As I sat under my desk, I considered Mother Maude&#x2019;s song in this new and strange context. Her music never brought her any wide acclaim outside of the Bible Belt. The notion that her song would be part of the soundtrack for a movie was ridiculous&#x2014;unless, that is, the movie had something to do with the camp. I gripped the chair and pressed my face harder into the seat cushion. In my front pocket, my cell vibrated with an incoming call. I turned it off. I breathed, clearing my brain of distractions. My breath became deeper, more precise. I don&#x2019;t know how long it was&#x2014;thirty minutes? an hour?&#x2014; before there came a knock. I reared back, slamming my head against the top of the desk. The doorknob jiggled. Someone was frantic, calling out my name, &#x201c;Will? Will?&#x201d; It was my friend Bevy, who had planned on meeting me at the library this very afternoon. I had for- gotten about it until right this second.</p><p>&#x201c;You just missed him,&#x201d; I called out. &#x201c;Come back tomorrow.&#x201d; </p><p>She hit the door with what sounded like her fist. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not playing,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>A graduate of law school and a tireless advocate for social justice, Bevy had what people called &#x201c;direction.&#x201d; A thing my dissertation (and possibly my life) sorely lacked. My future in academia was in question, and she had agreed to help me sort out a plan for how to finish writing my dissertation. She excelled at strategy: locating the problem and determining the best solution for solving it. My dissertation was a queer analysis of Douglas Sirk films, but after finishing the first chapter on Dorothy Malone&#x2019;s campy performance in Writ- ten on the Wind, I lacked the intellectual stamina required to complete it. At twenty-six, I had been in school for most of my life; I was tired. I wanted to turn my brain off from thinking about ideas that were specific and erudite and try something else. Something that tested the body and let the mind alone.</p><p>When I opened the office door, Bevy was awash in fluorescent light. Her voice was deep and unforgiving: &#x201c;What are you doing?&#x201d; She said she&#x2019;d tried calling. &#x201c;I mean, what the fuck, dude?&#x201d; I pre- tended to yawn, and my mouth, liking the suggestion, stretched into a real one. &#x201c;So imagine,&#x201d; I lied, &#x201c;I fell asleep in my office.&#x201d; I stepped back, my eyes adjusting to the bright hallway. Bevy was in her lawyering outfit. Her black hair parted down the middle. Foundation blended into her moon-pale skin. Her suit tailored to the square angles of her body, slightly wrinkled from a full day at the firm where she worked. Just the sight of her, adorned in all this evidence of her full and busy life, racked me with guilt.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, Bevy,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>Her face relaxed, and she sighed. She wouldn&#x2019;t press me any further. I imagined she would treat her clients like this: hone in on the lies worth pursuing and wave away the ones that weren&#x2019;t. Our friendship was built on her mastery of this skill. We had met at a crowded gay bar downtown a few years before. Bevy was going from table to table handing out fliers encouraging queers to vote in the upcoming state elections, and I was waiting for a date, someone I had met online. She slapped a neon-green handbill on my table. &#x201c;So what&#x2019;s your story?&#x201d; she said, and I said, &#x201c;Do what?&#x201d; She laughed. &#x201c;Do what? Did I stutter?&#x201d; she asked, mocking my drawl. I had my canned answers. The vagaries I told boyfriends and fellow grad students and professors when they asked me to account for myself. But with Bevy and her straightforwardness, I froze. She must have recognized the bewildered expression on my face. A look that told her my story could not be summed up in a few words. So she changed tactics. She laughed again, more gently this time, and gave my arm a squeeze. She whispered, &#x201c;No worries, hon,&#x201d; and moved along. Later in the night, after it was clear my date wasn&#x2019;t coming, she circled back and ordered us drinks&#x2014; Long Island iced teas. We kept the conversation light, discussing our hatred of the second Bush, an easy point of reference back then.</p><p>From that night on, a friendship developed. Anytime she needed a plus one and her girlfriend&#x2014;a doctor in residency&#x2014;was too busy, I was called. I joined her for protests, too, outside the offices of public officials who had attracted her ire. If she believed in a cause, she supported it tirelessly. (I flattered myself in believing I was one of them.) She did most the talking when we were together. Which I didn&#x2019;t mind, even encouraged. She told me about her hometown in Iowa; about her parents, both high school teachers and semi supportive of her interest in girls; about her goals&#x2014;after practicing law for five years, she planned to go into public service and run for local office. The only hiccup was her inability to pass the bar. &#x201c;Like most standardized tests,&#x201d; she told me, &#x201c;the bar is racist and sexist.&#x201d; She was currently studying for her third try. I asked her once how a test like that could be prejudiced, and her eyes squinted, and she said, &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t it obvious?&#x201d; and I said, &#x201c;Oh, right,&#x201d; like I had remembered the answer even though I had no clue. About me, she knew very little. She knew I was from the South but thought Tennessee since I had attended Vanderbilt. I didn&#x2019;t see any reason to correct her. She never asked about my parents. Perhaps she sensed a tender subject in how little I mentioned them.</p><p>She&#x2019;d never seen me just after one of my spells, either. If she noticed anything peculiar about my behavior today, she had the grace to keep it to herself. She leaned against the puke-colored wall as I packed up, thumbing through e-mails on her smartphone. The picture of professionalism. I had no delusions: Bevy was more import- ant than I was. Her time too valuable to be squandered. I told her so as I shoved my laptop and papers into my satchel, trying to be quick. When I was ready, she looked up from her phone and nodded for me to follow her out, not a trace of resentment in her face. She looped her arm through mine as we walked downstairs. A kindness like hers could break over you like a strong wave, nearly bringing you to your knees. As with other people in my life, a gulf of the unsaid lay between us. She was different, however, because she&#x2019;d not let that stop her from cobbling together a relationship with me. I couldn&#x2019;t understand it any more than she could probably understand my own strange ways. We didn&#x2019;t question it. Wasn&#x2019;t our style. Outside, she guided me through the empty campus, down a sidewalk edged with sprays of periwinkles, to the concrete parking garage near the library. There was no need for her to tell me she was taking me home. On this, at least, we understood each other perfectly. </p></p><h2>Strangling on the Stage, The (A Fethering Mystery, 15)</h2><p><b><i>The local dramatic society provides fertile ground for murder in the brand-new Fethering mystery</i></b><br>When Jude agrees to lend her vintage chaise lounge for the local Amateur Dramatics Society's production of George Bernard Shaw's The Devil's Disciple, little does she realize she'll end up in a starring role.

This centennial event was called the Dark Congress. <br> <br> In the second century b.c., however, the Dark Congress failed to resolve their conflicts. Instead, the Congress ignited into a war that drove wedges between the various demon races from that time until now. And all of it began as a result of Kandida, the great North African river demon, being nearly killed by forces in the Congress and magically entombed in the riverbank. <br> <br> But now, Kandida is free, and for the first time in centuries, the Dark Congress is being called again. All demon races and other varieties of supernatural creatures have been called to gather at the Hellmouth in Providence, Rhode Island. Some gather in hopes of resolution, some in favor of war, and Kandida is tasked to broker a treaty and guide the Congress to peace, wherein everyone might simply agree to disagree. And so the demons gather under a banner of a truce. <br> <br> But the demons still harbor many bitter disagreements with one another. The Congress must have an arbiter of these conflicts, and that someone is Buffy Summers. <br> <br> Buffy is horrified and disgusted to be included. After all, she is not a demon...is she? She knows so little about her powers that she cannot say for certain where they truly spring from. How can she spend so much time wallowing in the darkness without becoming part of it? Can she possibly agree to a truce with all the horrors of the world, and allow them to come Providence without any attempt to stop them? And does she have a choice?</p><p>Christopher Golden is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of novels for adults and younger readers.

Yet diplomats and reporters did not believe it. And the longest court case of the century failed to explode Anna Anderson&#39;s claim to be the Tsar&#39;s youngest daughter, Grand Duchess Anastasia. Anthony Summers and Tom Mangold spent five years tracking down witnesses and long-lost documents. The search led to Moscow, Tokyo and Washington and their persistence finally paid off when they found a suppressed official dossier - the File on the Tsar. It shows that the public was fed a lie.

Someone once said, Grief never ends...but it changes. It is a passage, not a place to stay. Grief is not a sign of weakness, nor a lack of faith...It is the price of love. If you have ever lost someone you love, you know how deep the wound cuts. In Tears to Joy, author Mike Tucker shares from his heart his struggles through the heartache of grief after the death of his wife of more than 40 years, Gayle Anne Whitacre Tucker. Her death affected every corner of his life, both personal and professional. He didn t only lose a wife but a ministry partner as well. For years as a pastor, chaplain, and counselor, Mike taught grief recovery classes. While he had experienced losses in his life, he had never known the life-altering devastation that can only be realized through the loss of a spouse or child. His life was in shambles, and he found himself putting to the test everything he had taught about grief recovery through the decades. In sharing his story, Mike also shares research and material that he found helpful and reliable in the process of recovery. While Mike s experience may differ widely from yours everyone s grief journey is different there are inevitable similarities. And it is in the areas of similarity that you will find the greatest help in dealing with your loss. It is the author s hope that in the midst of sorrow, Tears to Joy will bring you courage as you navigate through life s most difficult journey.</p><p></p><h2>Transference and Counter-Transference</h2><p>This book, whose central theme is counter-transference, had considerable impact in Latin America, and also aroused interest and confirmation in other psychoanalytic centers of North America and Europe. Racker argued that transference and counter-transference are the two components of a unity that reciprocally give life to one another and create the interpersonal relationship in the analytic setting. The counter-transference encompasses the analyst&#39;s total response to the transferences of the patient and to his or her own transferential reactions to the person of the analysand. It is a decisive factor for the understanding and interpretation of the patient&#39;s psychological processes.</p><p></p><h2>In Court: And Other Stories (Modern Classics)</h2><p>&#34;In Court&#34; brings together stories written over a span of many years.

Is religion dangerous to a culture? - Was there a prophecy that this would happen? - Where does this leave the future?&#34;If we find those answers,&#34; writes Zacharias, &#34;they will spell life, steadying the soul even though the heart still aches.&#34;</p><p>Ravi Zacharias was born in India, immigrating to Canada at age twenty.

He entered the Trappist monastery of Gethsemani in Kentucky as a young man in his twenties, seemingly abandoning the promising literary career that lay before him. But from the silent cloister in which he spent all but the last few weeks of his life, his influence spread worldwide through his writing, primarily on topics related to the spiritual life--a subject which he demonstrated to be very broad indeed. His life of dialogue led him to explore a range of contemplative practices, particularly Buddhism, and he was one of the pioneers in raising awareness of Buddhist philosophy and practice among Westerners. <br><br>Mary Gordon, as a Catholic in critical dialogue with her church, came to explore Merton relatively late in her own journey, becoming fascinated with him as a fellow writer. She documents her exploration of Merton through his books--the ups and downs of the experience, areas of disagreement and sympathy, of annoyance and, ultimately, deep connection. It is a profoundly personal view of one of the great spiritual figures of our age, by an interpreter who, while disinclined to go easy on her famous subject, nevertheless reveals a great admiration and fascination with his life and work.</p><p>MARY GORDON is a novelist, essayist, memoirist, literary critic, and the McIntosh Professor of English at Barnard College. She is the author of many books, including <i>Final Payments</i>, <i>Circling My Mother</i>, <i>Reading Jesus</i>, <i>The Shadow Man</i>, and <i>The Company of Women</i>. She is the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship, the Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Award, an O Henry Award, and an Academy Award for Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In March 2008, Governor Eliot Spitzer named Mary Gordon the official New York State Author and gave her the Edith Wharton Citation of Merit for Fiction. She was inducted as a member of the inaugural class of the New York Writers Hall of Fame in 2010.&#x201c;Ardent, heartfelt, headlong: with these words Mary Gordon lovingly penetrates to the core of Thomas Merton&#x2019;s ongoing importance, but the same words apply to her achievement. Gordon is the ideal reader of Merton, matching his intelligence, irony, and authentic feel for the world beyond words. Her book brings his books back to life, and belongs with them from now on.&#x201d;&#x2014;James Carroll, author of <i>Constantine&#x2019;s Sword </i>and <i>The Cloister<br><br></i>&#x201c;Only a writer as talented as Mary Gordon could have written about a writer as talented as Thomas Merton. I've read dozens of books about my hero, the Trappist monk Thomas Merton, and suspected that I couldn't learn much that was new.

Mary Garland has added many new entries on contemporary authors and on literary trends in the German Democratic Republic, as well as entries on authors whose reputations have grown in the past ten years. In addition, Garland has brought up to date the entries for living authors and corrected bibliographical information given within entries. As in the earlier edition, the aim throughout has been to balance the needs of the academic user consulting the <em>Companion</em> for enlightenment on a specific topic with the needs of the general reader seeking a companionable introduction to the German literary achievement. Thus the <em>Companion</em> presents factual information in easily accessible, readable form. Within a single alphabetical sequence, the <em>Companion</em> features not only concise biographies of writers but also synopses of works; entries on literary movements and styles; accounts of important figures and events in history, politics, and the arts and sciences; and many entries relating to the intellectual, social, and political background of Germany.

It is addressed not only to specialists and students, for whom it has long been an essential work of reference, but also to the general reader. The entries, arranged in a single alphabetical sequence, cover authors and their major works, and also historical, intellectual, and cultural background. For this new edition much of the original material has been thoroughly reworked in the light of up-to-date scholarship, and many completely new entries have been added, allowing improved coverage of the twentieth century, general topics, and women writers of all periods.

There is always the danger that a single person becomes so used to the bachelor or spinster routine that a sudden change in circumstances proves difficult to accommodate. Or so the folk wisdom goes. There is a similar piece of folk wisdom that claims that parents, on launching the last of their children, feel the loss acutely, rapidly declining into the empty-nest syndrome. Both these beliefs are largely false. Married couples &#x2013; or those choosing to live together as bidies-in (and there is no more appropriate term to express that notion than this couthy Scots expression) &#x2013; both adjust remarkably quickly to the sharing of bed and board. Indeed, after a few days, in many cases, a previous life is more or less entirely forgotten, and each person believes that he and she, or he and he, or she and she, have lived together for a very long time. In this way Daphnis and Chlo�, or Romeo and Juliet, can only too quickly become Darby and Joan, Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, or any other famous domestic couple.<br> &nbsp;<br> As for the received view about the so-called empty-nest syndrome, like many syndromes, it barely exists. In most cases, parents do feel a slight pang on the leaving of home by their children, but this pang tends to occur before the offspring go, and it is largely a dread of the syndrome itself rather than concern over the actual departure. In this way it is similar to many of the moral panics that afflict an imaginative society from time to time: the fear of what might happen in the future is almost always worse than the future that eventually arrives. So when the child finally goes off to university, or takes a gap year, or moves out to live with coevals, the parents might find themselves feeling strange for a day or two, but often find themselves exhilarated by their new freedom. Very soon it feels entirely normal to have the house to yourself, such is the rapidity with which most people can adjust to new circumstances. And of course if the child has been reluctant to leave home and has remained there until his late twenties, or even beyond, how much more grateful is the parent for this change. Empty-nest syndrome, then, might be redefined altogether, to refer to the feeling of anticipation and longing which affects those whose nest is not emptying quickly enough.<br> &nbsp;<br> For Matthew and his wife, Elspeth Harmony, the adjustment to married life was both rapid and thoroughly pleasant. Neither had the slightest doubt that the right choice had been made &#x2013; not only in respect of deciding to get married at all, but also in their choice of partner. Matthew loved Elspeth Harmony &#x2013; he loved her to the extent that everything that was associated with her, her possessions, her sayings, her friends and connections, were all endowed with a quality of specialness that attached to nothing else. The mug from which she drank her morning coffee was special because her lips had touched it; the tortoiseshell comb that she kept on top of the dressing table was special because it had belonged to Elspeth&#x2019;s grandmother rather than to any other grandmother; the shopping list that she wrote out to take with her to Valvona &amp; Crolla was special because it was in her handwriting. His affection for her was total, and touching.<br> &nbsp;<br> For her part, Elspeth could not believe the sheer good fortune that had brought them together. She had always wanted to get married, from her university days onwards, but as the years passed&#x202f;&#x2013; and she was only twenty-eight at the time of Matthew&#x2019;s proposal&#x202f;&#x2013; she had become increasingly concerned that nobody would ask her. There had been one or two boyfriends, but they had not been serious, and her intuitive understanding of this had meant that the relationships had been brief. She saw no point, really, in persisting with a man who would not be with her in a year or two&#x2019;s time. Why invest emotional energy in something that was not expected to last? In her view that led to disappointment and loss, and this could be avoided by simply not taking up with the man in the first place.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then Matthew came into her life, and everything changed. It was at such a difficult time, too, very close to that traumatic incident when she had succumbed to her irritation over Olive&#x2019;s mistreatment of Bertie &#x2013; Olive had used her junior nurse&#x2019;s kit to diagnose Bertie as suffering from leprosy &#x2013; and had pinched Olive&#x2019;s ear quite hard, something she had wanted to do for some time but which she had refrained from doing because to do so would be contrary to every principle of education and child care she had been taught. The fact that Olive richly deserved this pinch, and indeed might benefit from such a sharp reminder of moral cause and effect, was not a mitigating factor, and she had been obliged to resign from her position at the school. Matthew had been there to save her from the consequences of all this. While other boyfriends might have expressed regret over what she had done, and questioned its wisdom, Matthew sided with her completely and unequivocally, making it clear that he believed that the act of pinching Olive&#x2019;s ear was a blow for pedagogic sanity.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;There are many children who would be improved by such a pinch,&#x201d; he observed.<br> &nbsp;<br> Elspeth thought about this. In normal circumstances she would follow the party line and say that one should never raise a hand to a child or indeed pinch any of its extremities, but mulling over Matthew&#x2019;s pronouncement she came to the conclusion that she could think of quite a number of children who would benefit from a short, sharp pinch. Tofu, in particular, might be improved by a small amount of judiciously administered physical violence, even if only to stop him spitting at the other children. Perhaps if teachers spat at him he would get the message, but modern educational theory definitely frowned on teachers who spat at their pupils. That was the world in which we lived.<br> &nbsp;<br> And now all that was behind her. Matthew had rescued her from professional ignominy and given her a new purpose in life. He had showered her with love, and she felt nothing but tenderness for this kind and gentle man, who had given her his name, his home, his fortune, and himself.</p><h2>Ape and Essence</h2><p>Atomic and biological warfare have already destroyed most of the earth when, in the twenty-second century, an expedition is sent forth from New Zealand to explore North America</p><p>Aldous Huxley (1894&#x2013;1963), one of the most important English novelists of the twentieth century, is best known for <i>Brave New World</i>, <i>Point Counter Point</i>, <i>Crome Yellow</i>, and other novels, as well as his <i>Collected Short Stories</i>, also published by Ivan R.

I should go to the baths and&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>His habit was to swallow such lies with a drought of the liquor at hand, but tonight the bottle had been emptied already. &#x201c;And by what means will you have a child of mine while resting there?&#x201d; He laughed, a deep, drink-rough noise. &#x201c;Mourning the parting, will you lie with me the night before&#x2014;then abort whatever is thus got and have a bastard by another man, to return to this house and claim&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Lilly.&#x201d; Mother looked to her, fire on her tongue such that all her husband&#x2019;s anger seemed but sparks. Here was not the woman who called Lilly <i>sweetheart</i> and cradled her face between her hands; in such a temper, she looked taller than Father, her presence heavy with the soot of past fury. &#x201c;Dinner is over. Go to your room.&#x201d; <br>Lilly filched a glazed bun from the table because she refused to go without something sweet; wrapping it in a napkin as she went out, she shut the door behind her then put her ear to the keyhole. She dismissed the thought of capture, for the servants were all stiff-faced and silent at the edges of the room, or gone away to the kitchen if they could, ashamed to serve a family that would descend into this crudity&#x2014;unless all households of old blood were thus, and all servants must foster the ability to overlook lapses in decorum. <br>Though not given to eavesdropping, this argument concerned her; younger siblings would mean a sea-change, a reshuffling of priorities, danger along with freedom. The thick door muffled their voices but it didn&#x2019;t matter; when their war came to open battle they fought lustily, snide murmurs giving way to shouts. <br>&#x201c;If you won&#x2019;t have my child&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I promised you one, and that one is enough.&#x201d; She spoke now in her country burr, the honest voice; and softer, almost inaudible: &#x201c;I will not die with the second.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I know. I know. But you&#x2019;re better than your forebears. And what is she, this girl?&#x201d; <br>Giving a short laugh, Mother said, &#x201c;Your child.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;But no sweet girl for me, not soft-eyed: no, sharp and sea-loving&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>Miss Scholastika caught Lilly by the ear, and dragging her by it as she only did outside of Father&#x2019;s sight&#x2014;though happy to do so when Mother watched&#x2014;took her from the door. Both of them stayed quiet; Lilly bit her lip with eyes brimming, and Miss Scholastika kept herself to the pinch-mouthed look that the toothless excelled at. Only when they reached Lilly&#x2019;s room did the servant release her and ask, &#x201c;How shameless are you to be eavesdropping?&#x201d; Her voice quavered&#x2014;not angry, but fearful. &#x201c;There are things a child shouldn&#x2019;t hear.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;They voiced those before I left,&#x201d; Lilly said, reasonable, and flinched as the woman&#x2019;s hand came up; but Miss Scholastika only rested it against Lilly&#x2019;s cheek, the side of her face where the skin looked darkly bruised, brown and black, swollen. <br>Whispering, now, &#x201c;Both of them love you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes. Father wants a daughter he can parade or a son to become a merchant-marquis in his place, though.&#x201d; Lilly moved away, smiled&#x2014;and meant it. &#x201c;Ma&#x2019;am, I am happy.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know what that means,&#x201d; the old woman said, bitter, and before leaving added, &#x201c;Turn your mind to your books, child. I will want to hear what you know about our neighbor kingdoms tomorrow.&#x201d; <br>Lilly did no such thing, knowing that the servants&#x2019; ability to turn a blind eye extended to her behavior. Slipping off her satin shoes and stockings and full skirts, she donned instead last year&#x2019;s skirt&#x2014;it fell just above her ankles and still fitted her waist&#x2014;and on her feet put the soft leather shoes Mother gifted her with a conspiratorial wink and a finger held over her lips. <br> <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2013 by Shannon M.

The expression I caught on my face was so strange and new to me, I hardly recognized myself. It was almost as if some spirit in the house had possessed me for a while or as if the ghosts moved in and out of me at will, each changing my moods, my look, even the sound of my voice.<br><br>Back in Endfield Place in London, my great-uncle Richard and great-aunt Leonora's home, a ghost was supposedly trapped, the ghost of the original owner's mistress, poisoned by his wife. I didn't really believe in ghosts, but Grandmother Hudson used to tell me that a house such as this one, a house that had been home for so long to a family, was far more than just wood, stone, glass and metal thrown together to form a structure. It took on the character of the people who resided within it. Minutes, hours, days, weeks, months and years of reverberating with their voices, their laughter and their sobs filled it with memories.<br><br>"Think of it as if it were a gigantic sponge around us, absorbing our thoughts and actions, filling itself with our very natures until it became a part of us and we became forever a part of it. A new family can come in here and have the walls repainted, the floors covered with new carpet, different curtains and shutters hung on the windows, new furniture brought into every room, but we will linger in the heart of the house.<br><br>"The new owner might awaken one night and hear strange voices as the house replays some moment from our past like a sponge that has been squeezed and drips its contents, revealing what's really deep inside."<br><br>She smiled at my look of skepticism. Long ago I had stopped believing in tooth fairies and magic. Harsh reality was in my face too much.<br><br>"What I really mean, Rain, is when you look at something, whether it be a home or a tree or even the lake and see only what anyone else can see, you are partially blind. Take your time. Let things settle around you, in you. That takes some trust, I know, but after a while, it will become easier and easier and you will grow stronger and fuller because of it. You will become a part of all you see and all you touch," she told me.<br><br>These were rare moments, moments when she permitted herself to let down her own fortress walls and give me the opportunity to look in on whom she really was, a great and powerful lady on the outside, but no more than a little girl on the inside longing for love, for softness, for smiles and laughter and rainbow promises. Even at her age, she could blow out birthday candles and wish, too.<br><br>Much of her, of that, remained in the house. Her body rested in the graveyard a few miles away from it, but her spirit joined the spirits of the others who passed from room to room in a chain of memories lighter than smoke, looking for a way to resurrect some of the glory.<br><br>They were testing me, visiting me, challenging me by tinkering with my thoughts and feelings. They filled the shadows in the corners and whispered on the stairs, but I wasn't afraid even though I quickly began to have strange dreams, strange because they were about people I had never seen or met. Yet, despite that, there was something familiar about them, some laugh or wisp of a smile that filled me with even greater curiosity. I saw a little girl sitting all crunched up on a sofa, her eyes wide with surprise. I heard sobs through the walls. My eyes traveled down until they found two teenage girls listening, their mouths open with astonishment. Well-dressed people paraded through the hallways to rooms filled with displays of food and wine. There was the sound of violins and then a beautiful voice could be heard singing the famous aria from <i>Madama Butterfly</i>.<br><br>I could make little sense out of any of it, but I kept trying, searching for some clues, some answers. Even though I had lived in the house for a while before going to London, there was still much for me to look at and explore. I spent hours in the library perusing the books and then sifting through the old papers and some of the correspondence still kept in file cabinets and drawers. Most of it was about the various projects for development Grandfather Hudson had started. However, there were some personal letters, letters from old friends, people who had relocated to different states or even different countries, some of them old college friends.<br><br>I discovered that Grandmother Hudson had had a close girlfriend in finishing school who had married and moved to Savannah. Her name was Ariana Keely and her husband was an attorney. She had three children, two boys and a girl. The letters were filled with details about her children, but very little about herself and her husband. Occasionally, she would drift into something revealing and I would be able to read between the lines and understand that apparently neither she nor Grandmother Hudson believed they had found the happiness and the perfection both somehow had thought was inevitable for people who had been given all the advantages.<br><br><i>"As you say, Frances, we're privileged people,"</i> Ariana wrote in one letter, <i>"but all that seems to guarantee is a more comfortable world of disappointment full of more distractions, more ways to ignore reality."</i><br><br>It all made me wonder that if someone wealthy, born with status and advantages couldn't be happy, what should I really expect?<br><br>I was thinking about all this as Jake drove me home from the cemetery. Neither of us had spoken for quite a while. I sat gazing out of the window, but really not looking at anything. The sky continued to darken.<br><br>"You all right, Princess?" Jake asked finally.<br><br>"What? Oh, yes, Jake. I'm fine. Looks like it is going to pour."<br><br>"Yes," he said. "I was going to go into Richmond tonight, but I think I'll wait until morning, get up early and make the airport pickup."<br><br>I sat back. The dreary sky and my rush of sad memories filled me with a cold loneliness. You're too young to have to do battle with a great family, I told myself. I didn't ask for any of this. Thoughts about my mother, her husband and Aunt Victoria ganging up on me again tomorrow consumed me with dread.<br><br>"Maybe you oughta go to a movie or something, Princess," Jake said. "I can come by and take you, if you'd like."<br><br>"No thanks, Jake."<br><br>He nodded.<br><br>"Did you keep in contact with any of the friends you made when you went to school here?" he asked.<br><br>"No, Jake," I said smiling. He was trying hard, worrying about me. "I'm okay for a while. I'll keep myself busy by making myself dinner. Would you like to come to dinner?"<br><br>"Huh?" he asked.<br><br>"I've got a great recipe for chicken with peaches, something my mama used to make."<br><br>"Hmm. Sounds delicious," he said. "What time?"<br><br>"Come by about six."<br><br>"Should I bring anything?"<br>rd<br><br>"Just your appetite, Jake," I said and he laughed. "You know how well stocked Mrs. Hudson kept the house."<br><br>Jake nodded, looking at me in the rearview mirror. Something in his eyes told me he knew I should be calling her Grandmother Hudson. It occurred to me that Grandmother Hudson herself might have told him the truth, but he never asked me any prying questions. Sometimes, I thought he seemed like someone on the sidelines who knew everything and was just waiting and watching to see how it would turn out.<br><br>"That I do. I took her shopping enough," he said. "No matter how I assured her, she always behaved as if she could never get me when she needed me. She'd always hit me with something like, 'Why add another worry to the load you're already carrying on your shoulders?' That woman," he said shaking his head, "she never stopped trying to change me."<br><br>"She was very fond of you," I said.<br><br>He nodded, his eyes smaller, darker. Suddenly he was the one who grew quiet. Neither of us said another word until we pulled up to the house. The first drops began to fall.<br><br>"Thank you, Jake. I'll get my own door," I added before he could step out. "See you later, Jake."<br><br>"Okay, Princess," he called as I rushed up the steps and into the house.<br><br>I was excited. I had something nice to do. I was going to make us a wonderful meal, my first dinner in my own big house. Wouldn't Mama Arnold laugh if she saw me now?<br><br>About an hour before Jake arrived, however, the phone rang and my mood took a plunge back into the pool of depression. It was Grandmother Hudson's attorney, Mr. Sanger.<br><br>"I received a call from Grant, Megan and Victoria's attorney a little while ago, Rain. It looks like they're deciding to go forward with this challenge. They'll be requesting all Frances's medical records and they'll try to show she wasn't of competent mind when she changed the will and gave you so much. It still might all be just a tactic to get you to compromise."<br><br>"I know they're coming to see me tomorrow," I said. "Jake told me."<br><br>"I could be there if you'd like," he offered.<br><br>"That might just make it all nastier. I'll call you if I need you," I said.<br><br>"Sorry," he said, "but this is often the way these things can go."<br><br>With the wind picking up and whipping the rain at the windows and the roof of the house, and now the news of an impending legal war between me and my reluctant family, I couldn't keep the trembles from making my hands shake as I worked in the kitchen. I set the table and brought out the candelabra. I imagined Jake would like some wine. I didn't know anything about wine, so I decided to wait for him to make the choice. When I glanced at the grandfather clock in the hallway, I saw it was about three hours slow again.<br><br>That brought a smile to my face. I remembered how unconcerned Grandmother Hudson was about time. Most of the clocks in the house were off, even the electric ones in the bedrooms and kitchen. The fancy French clock in the office had a malfunction she never had fixed and her cuckoo clock in the breakfast nook sometimes worked, sometimes didn't. It could pop out at the most unexpected times. I asked her many times why she didn't get it and the other clocks repaired.<br><br>"At my age," she would say whenever I mentioned the clocks, "you don't want to be reminded how many hours have gone by."<br><br>I told her she wasn't that old. Jake was older than she was and didn't even think of slowing down.<br><br>"Jake," she said, "hasn't the sense to think about his age. If he did, he'd realize just how much of his life he's wasted."<br><br>I had to smile at that too. She sounded disapproving, but she never really criticized Jake. Her complaints were like whippings with wet noodles. I could see by the way they looked at each other that they had an endearing affection. It was just that whenever Grandmother Hudson smiled at him, she always looked away first as if smiling directly at him might shatter some essential glass wall they had to keep up between them. I thought it had something to do with employers and employees, but I could never be that way, no matter how rich I was.<br><br>Anyway, I would soon find out that there were other reasons.<br><br>I rushed to the door when the bell sounded. Jake surprised me by being dressed in a sports jacket and tie. He had a box of candy too.<br><br>"You didn't have to get dressed up, Jake," I said, laughing.<br><br>"I couldn't imagine coming to Frances's house for dinner without being properly attired," he said as he entered. "Sweets for the sweet." He handed me the candy.<br><br>"Thank you, Jake. Is it still raining pretty hard?"<br><br>"Slowing up. The front's moving north to get the Yankees now," he said.<br><br>When he saw the dinner table, he blew a low whistle.<br><br>"Very nice, Princess. Very nice. Looks like you learned a lot being an English maid, huh?"<br><br>"I know what bangers and mash is and I can speak some Cockney slang," I told him and he laughed. "I didn't know what to pick out for wine, Jake. I thought I'd leave that to you."<br><br>"Oh. Sure," he said.<br><br>"You know where the wine cellar is, right?" I asked him.<br><br>"I do, Princess," he said. "I even know which floorboards creak in this house."<br><br>I nodded. Of course he did. He had once lived here a long, long time ago.<br><br>"Okay, Jake. I'll get things started while you do that," I told him and went to the kitchen.<br><br>When I brought in our salads, he had already opened two bottles of wine and poured me a glass. It looked like he had poured himself a second already.<br><br>"One thing about Frances," he said. "She always had good wine, whether it be a good California wine or French. She was a very refined woman, classy," he added. "Let's have a toast to her." He held up his glass and I lifted mine and we tapped glasses after he said, "To Frances, who I'm sure is setting things right wherever she is."<br><br>We both took a long sip of our wine.<br><br>"Good-looking salad, Rain. Warm bread, too! I'm impressed already."<br><br>"Thank you, Jake."<br><br>"So," he said, "tell me about your time in London. I hope you were having some fun."<br><br>I described the school, told him about Randall Glenn, the talented boy from Canada who was studying to be a concert singer and how Randall and I had done a great deal of touring. I told him about Catherine and Leslie, the sisters from France, the showcase presentation I was in and all the encouragement I had received.<br><br>"It sounds like you should return then," he said. "I hope you don't get stuck here for some silly reason, Rain. Take advantage of your opportunities. Frances would want that. She'd be disappointed if you didn't," he said.<br><br>When Jake and I looked at each other, I couldn't help feeling there were things that were not being said. Every time he would mention Grandmother Hudson's name, he would get a misty glint in his eyes.<br><br>I brought out the main dish and he raved about it, saying someday I'd make a lucky man a wonderful wife.<br><br>"But you'll probably be one of these modern women who thinks the kitchen is beneath her," he added.<br><br>"I don't think so, Jake. Not the way I was brought up," I said.<br><br>He wanted to know more about my life growing up in Washington, D.C. He listened attentively, his face turning hard and his eyes cold when I described with more detail than ever before what exactly had happened to my stepsister Beneatha.<br><br>"No wonder your mother wanted to get you out of that world," he said.<br><br>Again, our eyes locked for a longer moment. I was surprised that Jake had already finished a bottle of wine himself and was well into the second. I had yet to finish my first glass. I looked down at my plate, pushed some of my food around with my fork and, without looking up, asked, "How much do you really know about me, Jake?" I lifted my eyes quickly. "How much did Mrs. Hudson tell you?"<br><br>He started to shake his head and stopped, a smile on his lips.<br><br>"She used to say you had a divining rod for the truth," Jake said softly.<br><br>"Divining rod?"<br><br>"You know, those things some people swear can find water."<br><br>"Oh." I nodded. "So what well of truth have I discovered, Jake?"<br><br>He laughed but then grew serious quickly.<br><br>"I know Megan is really your mother," he admitted. He fingered his wineglass. "I always knew."<br><br>"Grandmother Hudson told you?"<br><br>He nodded.<br><br>"What else did she tell you?"<br><br>He looked up.<br><br>"Not long before she died, she told me how you hunted down your real father in London," he said.<br><br>"I didn't exactly hunt him down."<br><br>"Those were her very words. I just knew she would do it, she said. Frances wasn't angry about it. She was impressed with your resourcefulness."<br></p><h2>Ditch the Wheat: 120 Paleo Recipes for a Gluten-Free Lifestyle</h2><p><i>Ditch the Wheat</i>.

Unspooling its history and legends, resolving myth with reality, Marq de Villiers and Sheila Hirtle have captured the splendor and decay of one of mankind's treasures. </p><p>Founded in the early 1100s by Tuareg nomads who called their camp "Tin Buktu," it became, within two centuries, a wealthy metropolis and a nexus of the trans-Saharan trade. Salt from the deep Sahara, gold from Ghana, and money from slave markets made it rich. In part because of its wealth, Timbuktu also became a center of Islamic learning and religion, boasting impressive schools and libraries that attracted scholars from Alexandria, Baghdad, Mecca, and Marrakech. The arts flourished, and Timbuktu gained near-mythic stature around the world, capturing the imagination of outsiders and ultimately attracting the attention of hostile sovereigns who sacked the city three times and plundered it half a dozen more. The ancient city was invaded by a Moroccan army in 1600, which began its long decline; since then it has been seized by Tuareg nomads and a variety of jihadists, in addition to enduring a terrible earthquake, several epidemics, and numerous famines. Perhaps no other city in the world has been as golden&#x2015;and as deeply tarnished&#x2015;as Timbuktu. </p><p>Using sources dating deep into Timbuktu's fabled past, alongside interviews with Tuareg nomads and city residents and officials today, de Villiers and Hirtle have produced a spectacular portrait that brings the city back to life.</p></p><p><p><b>Marq de Villiers</b><b> and Sheila Hirtle</b> are the coauthors of <i>Sable Island</i> and <i>Sahara: The Extraordinary History of the World's Largest Desert</i>. They live in Eagle Head, Nova Scotia.</p>So why was it important, this now faded and dusty desert capital? In a curious way, the reputation, or reputations, that accreted to Timbuktu predate its actual founding by many years, perhaps by a millennium or more. Or put the other way, Timbuktu itself became a shorthand metaphor for a much greater body of stories and legends about other places altogether. Some of the images inserted into outside imaginations over the centuries were grafted onto the city in the days of its magnificence under the Malian king Mansa Musa. Some of these, in turn, were legends that enveloped the earliest of the Arab invaders, in the seventh and eighth centuries, which in their turn were based on folklore derived at least in part from hints and suggestions of travelers going back to earliest antiquity.<br><br>Europe and the Maghreb, or Christianity and Islam, always had differing views of Timbuktu. In both places the city&#x2019;s reputation shifted over time, and the various versions overlapped, but they were never the same.<br>It&#x2019;s true that in both places gold was at the heart of the matter, at least at first. Before the Arabs were routinely traversing the desert and seeing for themselves, their geographers had stitched together from obscure fragments of folktale and legend a dream of riches untold, of gold lying on the ground for the taking, of immense wealth just waiting for the intrepid. But that romantic notion had faded by the fourteenth century, for traders followed the stories, and traders had harder heads than the storytellers, and saw for themselves what was, rather than what should be. The renowned traveler Ibn Battuta and his medieval colleagues did report on the great wealth of the Malian Empire and its storehouses of gold, for the trade in that and other commodities was the city&#x2019;s reason for being, and Timbuktu really was very wealthy; but Timbuktu also took on a reputation among Muslims for its learning. Many of the Arab travelers remarked on the city&#x2019;s thirst for books, as well as its traffic in gold, and wrote commentaries on its savants as well as its opulence.<br><br>From the fourteenth century on, pilgrims from Timbuktu went to the Holy Places of Islam, sometimes in great numbers and in immense caravans, but scholars from Mecca and Medina also went to live and study in Timbuktu, where they found themselves (sometimes to their evident chagrin) not as eminent or as learned as they had supposed. The university at Fez and the University of Sankor� in Timbuktu were said to be equivalent; commentaries on the Qur&#x2019;an produced at Sankor� were read in Jeddah and Cairo, and the eminent of both places corresponded over time and great distance, to the profit of both.<br><br>This Islamic combination of reputations, those of civilized affluence and scholarly erudition, were eventually fused in the mind of Moulay al-Mansur the Magnificent of Morocco, who in 1591 sent his armies across the desert hoping both to capture the gold trade and to extend his empire, and instead precipitated the city&#x2019;s gradual decay. The soldiers may have been emissaries from what they considered a high culture, but they killed or exiled most of the scholars, equating learning with disaffection, as conquerors are wont to do.<br>After that, the Arabs essentially lost interest, and for several dismal centuries the city was repeatedly besieged and sacked by a rolling roster of enemies&#x2013;the Bambara, the Fulani jihadists and the Tuareg&#x2013;until the French took it in 1893 and restored a semblance of order. Now the Bambara, who are in charge of Mali, are once again in charge of the city&#x2019;s destiny.<br><br>In Europe, where they knew and understood much less, the legend of Timbuktu took on a different color; or rather, retained a single color, the yellow of gold. Stories of caches of gold were teased out of the tales of Arab travelers, and the city became in the minds of the geographers and the merchants they served a fabulous place whose skyline was pierced with spires of gold, dreaming under the desert sun, rich beyond measure.<br><br>The legends were not entirely without merit. Of the gold that reached North Africa in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, two-thirds came from, or at least through, Timbuktu, and thence across the Sahara. The coins of the doges were Ghanaian gold from Timbuktu; the guineas that fueled the English commercial expansion were from Ghana (on the Guinea coast) and came to England via the markets of Timbuktu. It was natural, therefore, to think that Timbuktu was itself the origin of the gold and not just a way station on its route. In this way the city took on an almost luminous eminence in the European imagination, a fantastic land groaning under the ineffable weight of its affluence. Unlike the mutated Arab view, it was the pretty legends that seized the European imagination, not the reality. It was loot, not lore, that they coveted.<br><br>This image of great riches and a wondrous desert civilization lasted until colonial times; grafted onto it was the newer notion of its very remoteness&#x2013;never mind that Arab travelers had been going there for seven hundred years and more; Christians were forbidden, and often killed when they were caught. As late as Victoria&#x2019;s reign a popular saying in England was still &#x201c;from here to Timbuktu,&#x201d; which meant &#x201c;from here to as far away as you can get,&#x201d; adding a layer of inaccessibility and mystery to the legends of great opulence. Few men who went there, or tried to go there, or even went into the deep Sahara, ever returned to Europe, &#x201c;and those who did so told almost incoherent stories of madness through thirst, unspeakable cruelties of mirages, a fierce and terrible sun, and a vast limitless ocean of sand.&#x201d;1 Nothing much about money, though they knew it was there somewhere. <br><br>Why go, otherwise?<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Using Natural Finishes: Lime and Earth Based Plasters, Renders &amp; Paints (Sustainable Building)</h2><p>With the increasing awareness of eco-building techniques alongside the desire to make our homes healthier, the historical benefits of using natural renders and paints are being rediscovered.

Tiger!</i>), both much reprinted. <i>The Deceivers</i>, his final SF novel, appeared in 1981.<p> It's a colorful, whimsical romp that plays entertainingly with themes from Bester's peak years, though without his old driving, compelling savagery. Hero Rogue Winter is a "Synergist," acutely sensitive to the world's patterns: in one set-piece sequence he follows an intuitive trail from 12 drummers drumming in a street parade to the goal of a (metaphorical) partridge in a pear tree. Winter is also heir-apparent to the Maori Mafia, which controls much of the Solar System's crime, but he must single-handedly battle the dread mammoths of Ganymede to earn his crown. Meanwhile, he has fallen helplessly in love with a sexy nonhuman shapeshifter from Titan, making him vulnerable to minions of the insidious Manchu Duke of Death, who plans to smash the syndicate that's smuggling the priceless miracle fuel Meta from the heavily defended mines of Saturn's Chinese/Japanese-dominated moon Triton.</p><p> Bester crams this wild farrago of a narrative with wisecracks, junk science, circus glamor, odd catch phrases, bits of self-conscious cleverness and excess, Chinese esoterica like the Mirror-and-Listen Mystery, and his trademark typographic tricks. Amusing candyfloss nonsense; quite readable, but definitely not in the same league as his 1950s classics. <i>--David Langford, Amazon.co.uk</i></p></p><h2>Doctor Who: The Awakening (The Doctor Who Library, Book 95)</h2><p>The TARDIS time machine accidentally lands Doctor Who and his friends in the ruins of a church crypt</p><p>Eric Pringle was born and bred in Morpeth, Northumberland, and took a degree in English and American Literature at Nottingham University. After spending several years working in insurance, he ended up writing and editing various publications, including staff newspapers. After deciding to take up writing as a career, Pringle wrote plays and one-off episodes for series on HTV, Yorkshire TV and BBC 2, including The Cornforth Practice in 1974. His play, Jogger, was made by Radio 4 in 1983 and a play in the series The Ten Commandments was transmitted by the BBC&#39;s World Service. Much of Pringle&#39;s more recent work has been for the radio, including adaptations of The Wolves of Willoughby Chase and J. B. Priestley&#39;s The Good Companions. His 2001 Radio 4 play Hymnus Paradisi about the life of composer Herbert Howells won a Sony Award. Also in 2001, his children&#39;s novel, Big George, illustrated by Colin Paine, was published by Bloomsbury. This has been followed by two sequels: Big George and the Seventh Knight (2002) and Big George and the Winter King (2004).</p><h2>The First World War</h2><p>The First World War created the modern world. A conflict of unparalleled ferocity far beyond its European epicentre, it broke the century of relative peace and prosperity which we associate with the Victorian era. It unleashed both the demons of the twenieth century - pestilence, military destruction and mass death - and the ideas which continue to shape our world today - modernism in the arts, new approaches to psychology and medicine, and radical ideas about economics and society. An event of this scale and complexity needs a great historian to portray it, and in his new book, John Keegan fulfils a life-long ambition to write the definitive book on the war. It was of course foremost a fascinating new interpretations of the military events. But the war also acted as a formidable engine for social change throughout the world, and this too is brilliantly conveyed in Keegan&#39;s fascinating and magisterial work.</p><p>Despite the avalanche of books written about the First World War in recent years, there have been comparatively few books that deliver a comprehensive account of the war and its campaigns from start to finish. <i>The First World War</i> fills the gap superbly. As readers familiar with Keegan's previous books (including <i>The Second World War</i> and <i>Six Armies in Normandy</i>) know, he's a historian of the old school. He has no earth-shattering new theories to challenge the status quo, no first-person accounts to tug on the emotions--what he does have, though, is a gift for talking the lay person through the twists and turns of a complex narrative in a way that is never less than accessible or engaging.<p> Keegan never tries to ram his learning down your throat. Where other authors have struggled to explain how Britain could ever allow itself to be dragged into such a war in 1914, Keegan keeps his account practical. The level of communications that we enjoy today just didn't exist then, and so it was much harder to keep track of what was going on. By the time a message had finally reached the person in question, the situation may have changed out of all recognition. Keegan applies this same "cock-up" theory of history to the rest of the war, principally the three great disasters at Gallipoli, the Somme, and Passchendaele. The generals didn't send all those troops to their deaths deliberately, Keegan argues; they did it out of incompetence and ineptitude, and because they had no idea of what was actually going on at the front.</p><p> While <i>The First World War</i> is not afraid to point the finger at those generals who deserve it, even Keegan has to admit he doesn't have all the answers. If it all seems so obviously futile and such a massive waste of life now, he asks, how could it have seemed worthwhile back then? Why did so many people carry on, knowing they would die? Why, indeed. <i>--John Crace, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>The First World War created the modern world. A conflict of unprecedented ferocity, it abruptly ended the relative peace and prosperity of the Victorian era, unleashing such demons of the twentieth century as mechanized warfare and mass death. It also helped to usher in the ideas that have shaped our times--modernism in the arts, new approaches to psychology and medicine, radical thoughts about economics and society--and in so doing shattered the faith in rationalism and liberalism that had prevailed in Europe since the Enlightenment. <br><br>By the end of the war, three great empires--the Austro-Hungarian, the Russian and the Ottoman--had collapsed. But as Keegan shows, the devastation extended over the entirety of Europe, and still profoundly informs the politics and culture of the continent today. His brilliant, panoramic account of this vast and terrible conflict is destined to take its place among the classics of world history. <br><br>Reader Bio:<br><br><b>Simon Prebble </b>has had more than 60 roles in television plays, serials, and documentaries, including <i>Hamlet, Six Wives of Henry VII,</i> and <i>Photofinish</i> and played Martin Chedwyn on the CBS soap opera <i>As the World Turns.</i></p><h2>The dyadic cyclone: The autobiography of a couple</h2><p>Book by Lilly, John Cunningham</p><p></p><h2>The Wanderer (A Magnus Iceland Mystery)</h2><p><p><b>'Michael Ridpath is trouncing the Scandinavians on their home turf.

It came closer and closer... the hair on the back of my neck was sticking straight out. I finally saw it- and it was alive!</em> <br><br>As the story becomes spookier and spookier, Reiner pauses to ask "Shall we turn the page- or is it too scary?" That's for you to decide! <br><br>Parents and children can read along together as they listen to spooky sound effects and Carl Reiner's hilarious performance of <em>Tell Me a Scary Story</em>... on the accompanying CD.</p><p>For all those kids who love to be scared on Halloween--but not <i>too</i> scared, award-winning director and comedy writer Carl Reiner produces a real spine chiller. He also offers plenty of outs for the faint of heart: "Is it getting too scary for you? Should I keep going? Okay, if you say so." No red-blooded young reader will be able to resist this tantalizing tale of monsters and mystery. The narrator (depicted by Jerry Seinfeld's <i>Halloween</i> illustrator, James Bennett, to look exactly like Carl Reiner) cozies up with his granddaughter to tell her all about the man he met when he was a child: Mr. Neewollah. Mr. Neewollah has a crooked smile (we have several creepy child's-eye views) and some very strange hobbies. Young Carl is lured into his basement workshop only to be scared out of his wits by fake eyeballs, creaking doors, and creepy things covered with cloth--not to mention hideous monsters. But is Mr. Neewollah truly as sinister as he seems? <p> In his first book for children, Reiner gets that kids love to be spooked--and to know that all is well, too. Bennett's exaggerated illustrations, featuring weird angles and vivid, in-your-face close-ups, are a good match for Reiner&#x2019;s Halloween tale. Too busy in your own evil workshop to read aloud to the kids? Fear not! The book includes a CD featuring Reiner reading the story accompanied by eerie sound effects.

Wartime. <br><br>A six-year-old boy goes to spend the summer with his grandmother Alida in a small town near the Canadian border. With the men all gone off to fight, the women are left to run the farms. There&#x2019;s plenty for the boy to do&#x2014;trying to help with the chores, getting to know the dog, and the horses, cows, pigs, and chickens. <br><br>But when his cousin Kristina goes into labor, he can&#x2019;t do a thing. Instead, the house fills with women come to help and to wait, and to work on a quilt together. This is no common, everyday quilt, but one that contains all the stories of the boy&#x2019;s family. The quilt tells the truth, past and future: of happiness, courage, and pain; of the greatest joy, and the greatest loss. And as they wait, the women share these memorable stories with the boy.</p><p>A companion to <i>Alida&#x2019; s Song</i> and <i>The Cookcamp</i>, Gary Paulsen's <i>The Quilt</i> spends another summer with "the boy" and his grandmother, Alida. World War II is being fought in Europe, and the boy&#x2019;s mother, working in a munitions factory in Chicago, sends her six-year-old son to stay with his grandmother in Minnesota. When Alida&#x2019;s neighbor Kristina goes into labor, Alida packs up the boy and goes to Kristina&#x2019;s farm to help. Mystified, the boy watches as other women arrive, water is boiled, and a quilt is brought out. Now it&#x2019;s time to listen, as the quilt--through the women--tells its stories about family, love, loss, and strength. <p> As in Paulsen&#x2019;s many other semi-autobiographical stories for young readers (the <i>Brian</i> books, <i>Guts</i>, etc.), the author&#x2019;s voice is never far beneath the surface. His bitterness towards his own mother, for example (as revealed in the foreword), comes across in lines like this: "Soon, though, other people--men--came to visit her and she started to do very grown-up things. He did not fit in, and when life with his mother became too difficult, he went to live with his grandmother." Although this presence may be irritating to some readers, the details of a remembered time on a farm with wonderfully strong women should appeal to all. (Ages 8 to 12) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>Gary Paulsen is the author of more than 100 books, among them the bestselling <i>Brian&#x2019;s Winter, The River, Brian&#x2019;s Return</i>, and <i>Brian&#x2019;s Hunt</i>. He divides his time between a ranch in New Mexico and his boat on the Pacific Ocean.</p><h2>The Preference for the Primitive: Episodes in the History of Western Taste and Art</h2><p>This long-awaited book is a study of a recurring phenomenon in the history of Western art, namely the feeling that older and less sophisticated (i.e. 'primitive') works of art are somehow superior to later and more refined ones. In a closely argued and richly documented narrative Professor Gombrich traces the history of the debates on this subject from classical antiquity to the radical primitivism of modern times, attempting at the same time to provide a psychological explanation of the phenomenon.<p>This book is a documentary study of a recurring phenomenon in the history of changing taste in the visual arts, namely the feeling that older and less sophisticated (i.e. 'primitive') works are somehow morally and aesthetically superior to later works that have become refined, soft and decadent. Gombrich traces the existence of such feelings right back to classical antiquity, and he links them with a crucial psychological observation made by Cicero to the effect that over-indulgence of the senses leads to a feeling of disgust. He also demonstrates the importance of the profoundly influential metaphor, first articulated in antiquity and taken over by Vasari, that compares the history of art to the growth of an organism: like a living organism, art is born and grows to maturity (and therefore perfection), then decays and finally dies. Successive generations of artists and critics, believing the art of their own time to be past maturity, have interpreted the smooth refinement and sensual appeal of contemporary works as symptoms of decline and corruption, and have come to admire earlier works, despite their 'immaturity', as possessing superior qualities of sincerity, innocence and ruggedstrength. With the advent of modernism at the turn of the twentieth century this admiration took a radically regressive new twist as artists turned their backs on tradition altogether and found inspiration in the art of exotic cultures and in the works of children and the insane.</p><p>Summing up more than forty years of study and reflection, the book presents a closely argued narrative supported by extensive quotation of key passages that document with precision the role of authors, critics and artists in shaping and changing opinion. After reviewing the classical authors whose writings largely set the terms of the debate, Gombrich then charts its progress from its revival in the eighteenth century, documenting the often subtle shifts of taste and judgement that frequently focus on the pivotal role of Raphael as a touchstone in the history of taste. In the final chapters he turns to the truly revolutionary primitivism of the twentieth century, to much of which he has himself been an eyewitness.</p><p>Important both as a personal testament and as a documentary anthology, this long-awaited new book from one of the world's most distinguished art historians provides a deep and revealing insight into the history and psychology of taste.</p></p><p>Sir Ernst Gombrich was one of the greatest and least conventional art historians of his age, achieving fame and distinction in three separate spheres: as a scholar, as a popularizer of art, and as a pioneer of the application of the psychology of perception to the study of art. His best-known book, The Story of Art - first published 50 years ago and now in its sixteenth edition - is one of the most influential books ever written about art. His books further include The Sense of Order and Art &amp; Illusion, as well as a total of 11 volumes of collected essays and reviews. Gombrich was born in Vienna in 1909 and died in London in November 2001. He came to London in 1936 to work at the Warburg Institute, where he eventually became Director from 1959 until his retirement in 1976. He won numerous international honours, including a knighthood, the Order of Merit and the Goethe, Hegel and Erasmus prizes. Gifted with a powerful mind and prodigious memory, he was also an outstanding communicator, with a clear and forceful prose style. His works are models of good art-historical writing, and reflect his humanism and his deep and abiding concern with the standards and values of our cultural heritage.&#39;The great strength of this book is its historical sweep ... of interest to specialists and general readers alike.&#39; (Colin Rhodes, Loughborough University, The Burlington Magazine) &#39;A masterpiece of skilful discourse.&#39; (Nigel Spivey, The Daily Telegraph) &#39;Gombrich is as usual masterly and vastly erudite.&#39; (Martin Gayford, The Sunday Telegraph) &#39;Gombrich brings his massive learning to bear on a very interesting set of questions.&#39; (The Spectator) &#39;Gombrich remains a giant of art history who tried to demystify the processes by which art is made. If Winckelmann yearned for &#39;noble simplicity&#39; in art, and if Wackenroder preached &#39;pious simplicity&#39;, then Gombrich can be regarded as the High Priest of &#39;rational simplicity&#39;.&#39; (James Hall, Times Literary Supplement) &#39;Throughout, Gombrich&#39;s account is supported by his easy familiarity with the writings of philosophers and aestheticians, of anthropologists and psychologists, but in the end what gives his approach such a rich tension is the fact that he remained fundamentally and unfashionably committed to the idea that an increase in mimetic skill represented a form of progress, and that the term primitive did not need to be hedged about with guilt-wracked inverted commas.&#39; (Apollo) &#39;Has there been an individual who could match Gombrich&#39;s gargantuan grasp of classical sources, the sheer scope of his reading? No ... The Preference for the Primitive ... is lively and can be assimilated by artists, art historians and general readers alike.&#39; (Modern Painters) &#39;The book is a remarkable one, demonstrating in full measure Gombrich&#39;s extraordinary erudition ... acts as a convenient summary of many of the themes and issues to which he devoted a long and exceptionally distinguished career.&#39; (Charles Saumarez Smith, Director, National Gallery, London, Literary Review) &#39;Take(s) on just about the weightiest and most controversial subject currently available for art-historical picking-over. For Gombrich to delay until his final book before taking on the appetite for perfectionism is akin to Michelangelo waiting until he was 92 before embarking upon the Sistine ceiling.&#39; (Waldemar Januszczak, The Sunday Times) &#39;The Preference for the Primitive deserves a place within any art library, completing the life&#39;s work of an important twentieth century writer.&#39; (Art Documentation) &#39;Gombrich narrates these enchanting chapters in the history of taste with his usual clarity and ear for the eloquent quotation.&#39; (The New Republic) &#39;Over the last half century we have come to expect from Gombrich work of extensive and detailed scholarship, nuanced, balanced, and rich in insight. This, his final work, upholds the standard he set ... This work is a final treasure for all interested in art and the history of ideas.&#39; (Religious Studies Review)</p><h2>Post-Continental Philosophy: An Outline (Transversals: New Directions in Philosophy)</h2><p>Post-Continental Philosophy outlines the shift in Continental thought over the last 20 years through the work of four central figures: Gilles Deleuze, Alain Badiou, Michel Henry, and Fran�ois Laruelle. Though they follow seemingly different methodologies and agendas, each insists on the need for a return to the category of immanence if philosophy is to have any future at all. Rejecting both the German phenomenological tradition of transcendence (of the Ego, Being, Consciousness, Alterity, or Flesh), as well as the French Structuralist valorisation of Language, they instead take the immanent categories of biology (Deleuze), mathematics (Badiou), affectivity (Henry), and axiomatic science (Laruelle) as focal points for a renewal of thought. Consequently, Continental philosophy is taken in a new direction that engages science and nature with a refreshingly critical and non-reductive approach to life, set-theory, embodiment, and knowledge. However, each of these new philosophies of immanence still regards what the other is doing as transcendent representation, raising the question of what this return to immanence really means. John Mullarkey&#39;s analysis provides a startling answer. By teasing out their internal differences, he discovers that the only thing that can be said of immanence without falling back into transcendent representation seems not to be a saying at all but a &#39;showing&#39;, a depiction through lines. Because each of these philosophies also places a special value on the diagram, the common ground of immanence is that occupied by the philosophical diagram rather than the word. The heavily illustrated final chapter of the book literally outlines how a mode of philosophical discourse might proceed when using diagrams to think immanence.</p><p><p>...</p><br><p>Reviewed by Alistair Welchman, University of Texas at San Antonio, 22 Oct 2007. for Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews.</p><br> (<i>Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews</i>)</p><h2>The Abundant Herds: A Celebration of the Cattle of the Zulu People</h2><p>The Zulu name for this kind of coloured Nguni cow is inala, or &#39;abundance&#39;.

When he's happy, he "prrrr-ips." And when he's nervous, he charves cheese (a cross between chewing and carving). Donnica Perfecto, his exact opposite, lives across the street. She's rich, whiny, and wants to go to Hollywood. When a talent show comes to town looking for a child with a unique talent, Donnica is determined to learn how Oggie charves. In <i>Oggie Cooder Party Animal</i> (2009, both Scholastic), Donnica is forced to invite Oggie to her birthday party, but she has a plan to prevent him from coming.

It is here, in the midst of ancient tensions and new calamity, that two sisters are caught in adeadly web of deceits.</p><p>Arilou is proclaimed a beautiful prophetess&#x2014;one of the island's precious oracles: a Lost. Hathin, her junior, is her nearly invisible attendant. But neither Arilou nor Hathin is exactly what she seems, and they live a lie that is carefully constructed and jealously guarded.</p><p>When the sisters are unknowingly drawn into a sinister, island-wide conspiracy, quiet, unobtrusive Hathin must journey beyond all she has ever known of her world&#x2014;and of herself&#x2014;in a desperate attempt to save them both. As the stakes mount and falsehoods unravel, she discovers that the only thing more dangerous than the secret she hides is the truth she must uncover.</p></p><p><p>Frances Hardinge is the celebrated author of <em>Fly By night</em>, <em>Well Witched</em>, and <em>The Lost Conspiracy</em>. She spent her childhood in Kent, England, in a huge, isolated old house in a small, strange village, and from an early age she wrote stories filled with magic and vivid characters. Ms. Hardinge studied at Oxford University, where she was a founding member of a writers' workshop. This is her fourth novel.</p>Grade 6&#x2013;9&#x2014;It will take readers more than a few beats to find their bearings in this relentlessly inventive fantasy, but once they figure out the Lost (people who can send their senses out into the world and sometimes get lost from their bodies), the social relations among the colonized and colonizers of Gullstruck Island, and the physical world they inhabit, the story is gripping. Haithin is the nearly invisible viewpoint character, one of those people that you hardly realize is there, and the indispensable guide and interpreter of her sister, Arilou, who may or may not be one of the Lost. As members of a despised minority cast, the sisters are part of an elaborate scheme to convince outsiders of the worth of their village as a tourist attraction. Intrigue piles upon intrigue as the Lost are nearly exterminated and Haithin's people are blamed. Can the sisters survive the murderous crowds, fight their way through the jungles of Gullstruck, appease the violent volcanoes, and navigate the silly court life of the local ruler? Especially memorable are some of the secondary characters, including a traveling dentist who manipulates the masses while she drills teeth and a man who is nearly as unnoticeable as Haithin but who appears to be pulling the strings of state. Haithin's journey is, of course, epic. She faces hardship, tragedy, doubt, killer insects, and a river of lava and, in the end, becomes something of a myth herself. The author is as inventive with language as she is with social and cultural constructs. This novel is just plain fun.&#x2014;<i>Carolyn Lehman, Humboldt State University, Arcata, CA</i> END</p><h2>Chemical Bond: A Brief Introduction to Modern Structural Chemistry</h2><p>Great book for research, study, or review!</p><p></p><h2>The Degrees of the Zodiac Symbolized (Astrological Manuals)</h2><p>Each of the 360 degrees of the Zodiac has its own unique symbol and meaning.

He bridges the gap between ancient Israel (c.1400-586 B.C.E.) and Second Temple times (c.536 B.C.E.-70 C.E.) by showing the continuity between these eras and the gradual evolution of the biblical worldview, which formed the foundation of later rabbinic Judaism. The book focuses on the editing of the Torah, interpreting the textual evidence, most notably contradictions and redundancies, to show that the idea of a pluralistic understanding of Revelation can be traced back to the editing of the Torah itself. Knohl&#x2019;s interpretation of biblical composition challenges a popular trend in contemporary biblical scholarship: the idea that ancient Israel never existed as a historical reality, but was invented and &#x201c;retrojected&#x201d; back in time by later Israelite priests as part of their national myth.<br></p><p>Ground-breaking scholarship about how the Torah became the Jewish canon.

Part of me wanted to laugh, but most of me fairly cringed at what had just occurred. I didn't do particularly well with blood. This tended to be something of a hardship for one endeavoring to become a knight, dedicated to serving good King Runcible of Isteria, a ruler who more often than not had his heart in the right place. </p><p> The recently slain knight also had his heart in the right place. This had turned out to be something of an inconvenience for him. After all, if his heart had been in the wrong place, then the sword wouldn't have pierced it through, he wouldn't be dead, and I wouldn't have been in such a fix. </p><p> I stood there stupidly in the middle of Granitz's chambers. Like much of the rest of the castle, it was somewhat chilly...all the more so because I was only partly dressed and the sweat on my bare skin was feeling unconscionably clammy. There were long, elegant candles illuminating the room, giving it a rosy glow, since thick drapes had been drawn over the large windows to keep out both daylight and prying eyes. From nearby on the large and damaged four-poster bed, my lover -- and the knight's wife (well, widow) -- was letting out short gasps, trying to pull air into her lungs and only marginally succeeding. The tiled floor seemed to tilt under me for a moment, and I steadied myself as my mind raced, trying to determine what the hell I was going to do next. </p><p> The knight's name had been Sir Granitz of the Ebony Swamps, although he was generally referred to as "Sir Granite." The nickname had been well earned, for on the battlefield he had been indeed a sight to see. I had seen it myself, many a time...from a safe distance, of course, since my mother, God bless her, had not raised an idiot for a son. Understand: I did not, nor have I ever, shrunk from a fight when it was absolutely necessary. However, my definition of "absolutely necessary" wasn't precisely in keeping with that of everyone else in my immediate sphere. </p><p> For people like Granite, "absolutely necessary" included times of war, matters of honor, and similar esoterica. For me, the term "absolutely necessary" meant "self-defense." I considered war to be an utter waste of my time and energy, since most wars involved people I did not know arguing over matters I did not care about in pursuit of goals that would not have any direct impact upon me. As for honor, that was an ephemeral consideration. Honor did not feed, clothe, or protect me, and seemed to exist primarily to get otherwise inoffensive creatures into a world of trouble. </p><p> "Self-defense," however, was a consideration that I could easily comprehend. Whether it be an envious knight attacking me on horseback, an enraged dragon belching plumes of flame, or a squadron of berserker trolls swarming over the ramparts of a castle, those were instances where my own neck was at stake and I would happily hack and slash as the situation required so that I might live to see another sunrise. </p><p> I liked sunrises. They made anything seem possible. </p><p> Now, Granite...he was the type who would fight anywhere, anytime, at the least provocation. That is precisely the kind of attitude that gets one killed at a young age if one is not a formidable fighter. To his credit, that certainly described Granite. Well over six feet tall and built like a brick outhouse, he often found it necessary to enter a room sideways, his shoulders being too broad to be accommodated by a standard doorframe. </p><p> Sir Granite had returned most unexpectedly, at a moment that could best be described as inopportune. For at that particular point in time, I had been in the middle of opportuning myself of his wife. </p><p> As burly, as brusque, as fearsome as Granite had been, the Lady Rosalie had been the opposite. Delicate and pale, Rosalie had cast an eye that clearly fancied me in my direction. Considering that, at the time she did it, I was mucking out the stables and up to my elbows in horse manure, she clearly saw something within me not readily apparent from my surface appearance. She and old Granite had just come in from a ride; he perched upon his white charger, and she riding daintily sideways on a brown mare. She winked at me and I hurriedly wiped my hands on the nearest cloth, aware of the disheveled and frankly tatty sight I must have presented. The Lady Rosalie chose that moment to try and dismount. But her foot snagged on the stirrup and she tumbled forward, only my quick intervention preventing her from hitting the straw-covered floor. I caught her, amazed by how light she was. I'd bounced soap bubbles off my fingertips that had more substance. </p><p> For the briefest of moments, Rosalie insinuated her body against mine, mashing her breasts against my stained tunic. They were round and felt surprisingly firm beneath her riding clothes. It was not the fall that had carried her against me in that manner; she had done it deliberately with a subtle arching of her back that only I detected. Then, after the ever-so-brief gesture, she stepped back and put her hand to her throat in a fluttery manner. "Thank you, squire," she said, her voice having a most alluring musical lilt. </p><p> "Not...a problem, milady," I replied. </p><p> Old Granite did not seem to be the least bit supportive of my chivalric endeavors. His thick red mustache bristled and he said contemptuously, "I give you lesson after lesson, Rosalie, and still you can't so much as get off the damned horse. You shouldn't have caught her, squire. A far greater favor you'd have done her if you'd let her fall flat on her ass. It's the only way she's going to learn anything about successful mounting." </p><p> "Well...one of two ways," I said in a low voice, just enough for her to hear. Her cheeks colored, but not in embarrassment because she put a hand to her mouth to stifle what clearly sounded like a giggle. I grinned at her. She did not return the smile with her mouth, but it was clearly reciprocated in her eyes. </p><p> Granite smoothly jumped off his horse and thudded to the ground like a boulder. "Come, madam," he said, sticking out an elbow in a manner intended to be gallant but that instead simply appeared stiff and uncomfortable. This was not a man who was accustomed to the slightest gesture of gentility. She took his elbow and walked out with him, but glanced back at me just before they left. </p><p> From that moment, it was simply a matter of time. </p><p> I knew all about Granite. He was typical of Runcible's knights, spouting words of chivalry and justice, but doing whatever he desired behind the king's back. He made polite and politic noises to the king, but he could be as much of a brute as any common highwayman or any member of the Thugs' Guild, and he also had a string of mistresses in various towns and villages. He frequented the whores' tent, which was usually set up at the outskirts of an encampment during a campaign. More than one tart had supposedly come away from the amorous encounter with bruises to show for it when Granite was impatient with his own...performance. The mighty knight, you see, had a bit more trouble wielding his sword off the battlefield than on, if you catch my drift, and that difficulty translated to welts for those who couldn't easily overcome his problems. </p><p> I, however, had no such difficulties. </p><p> The Lady Rosalie, "heeding" her husband's suggestions to improve her riding abilities, took to the stables more and more frequently to get in practice time. Well...allegedly, that was the reason. But an intended hour of riding would end up an hour of conversing with me as I groomed and tended to the horses while she laughed and giggled and watched me perform my duties with a sort of doe-eyed fascination. I knew exactly where matters were taking us, and did absolutely nothing to deter them in their course. </p><p> One day she asked me to accompany her on a jaunt, since her husband had gone to deal with a minor uprising in the nearby city of Pell, and she was concerned lest bandits be wandering the roads. This, of course, wasn't her major concern. We rode several miles away from the good king's stables, chatting about trivialities, nonsense, and just about everything except for what really occupied our thoughts. By the lakeside, on a cool morning, nature took its course. </p><p> Let us just say that she did not ride exclusively sidesaddle. </p><p> I'm sure that I provided little more than an amusement to her, a dalliance. The obvious conclusion was that she was using me to get back at her husband, to make him jealous. But I doubt that was the case, because siccing the green-eyed monster upon Granite could only have fatal consequences. Rosalie may not have been the most polished apple to fall off the tree, but she was most definitely not suicidal. Maintaining a shroud of secrecy over our relationship heightened the likelihood of her keeping her pretty head on her shoulders. Besides, when you get down to it, isn't it the very illicitness of an affair, the forbidden nature of it, which makes it so exciting? Even pedestrian sex can be elevated to new heights when one isn't supposed to be having it. </p><p> That was probably what kept it going. Old Granite had made very clear to all and sundry that he thought very little of his wife's mental prowess. He considered her something of a twit. But twit or not, she ably concealed the existence of her tawdry little escapades (and I say that with only the fondest of recollections and greatest esteem) from this great warrior who thought himself one of the most canny and discerning of men. </p><p> Consequently, when it all came crashing down, it landed with a most pronounced thud. </p><p> The Pell situation, which started as something rather inconsequential, began to spiral out of control. Granite made a tactical error, you see. There had been a hard core of individuals utterly opposed to pouring more tax money into the king's coffers. I couldn't blame them, really. Most of the money paid in taxes didn't go into providing resources for public works, but instead either lined the pockets of key knights, or served to fund foreign wars that most of the peasants never heard of and didn't care about. </p><p> The hard core of individuals were endeavoring to organize protests, even stonewall against further taxes. The other peasants were reluctant to join with them. This came as no surprise to me. Being a peasant, I know the mind-set. One becomes so used to being downtrodden that one starts to believe that it's nature's intent that one should inhabit a low rung in society. Lack of movement is a formidable force to overcome. </p><p> The rabble-rousers called themselves the Freedom Brigade and set themselves up as enemies of the king and his policies. But they weren't enemies, really. An enemy is someone who has the capability to do you genuine harm. Calling this lot enemies was like referring to head lice as criminal masterminds. They had the ability to irritate, but they were no threat. Only one of the "Brigadiers" had any knack for rabble-rousing at all. I knew him from the old days. His name was Tacit, he was damned good-looking, and the women tended to swoon when they saw him coming. But swoon-inducers aren't necessarily great leaders of men, because men tend to mistrust other men who are that handsome. They start thinking that there's some other agenda in force, such as seeking out leadership just to get the attention and favors of the women, and perhaps they're not wrong to believe that. </p><p> Besides, Tacit wasn't the leader of the Brigadiers anyway. I don't even recall the name of the leader offhand; that's how forgettable he was. He was simply stolid and determined to change things, and wasn't particularly good at making that happen. </p><p> The truth was, the Brigadiers really just wanted to be in the favorable position enjoyed by those they were opposing, which is usually the case of protesters. If Granite had given them just a taste of the good life, the Freedom Brigade would have melted like a virgin's protests on her wedding night. One of the best ways to dispose of enemies -- even perceived ones such as the Brigadiers -- is to make them over into allies and friends. When someone is not truly in a position to hurt you, that is the time to approach him or her with an air of camaraderie. Respect. Bribery. The Freedom Brigade could easily have been bought off. Hell, I suspect they could have been retooled into a formidable squad of tax collectors that would have put the king's own men to shame. </p><p> But not old Granite, oh no. </p><p> For Granite was a fighting man, you see. Put him on a field with a sword and buckler, give him a squadron behind him, point him in a direction -- any direction -- and say, "Kill," and watch him go at it. As a slaughtering machine, he was a thing of beauty. There was a tendency to elevate him in positions of importance and rank as a consequence. It's understandable, I suppose. Put yourself in the place of the king. You come riding up to a field after the battle is done, there are bodies strewn all over the place like clothes at a brothel, and there's one man standing there, wavering slightly, wearing tattered armor, copious amounts of blood (none of it his), and a somewhat demented smile. You would tend to think that this fellow knows what he's about. Such was the case with Granite. </p><p> Unfortunately, what the king did not realize is that just because one was skilled at one means of controlling an uprising -- namely by whacking it until all of its internal organs are on the landscape -- did not automatically translate into any sort of aptitude for handling other situations. </p><p> When Runcible learned of the situation in Pell, he sent Granite, convinced that he was dispatching one of his best men to attend to it. Were Pell in the midst of full-scale riot, Granite might indeed have been just the fellow for it. But matters were still controllable. Why wade in with a broadsword when a whispering dagger would do the job? </p><p> Well, Granite used a broadsword and a half. He and his men rode in like the great damned king's own Ninth Army, stampeded through Pell, rounded up a dozen townspeople at random and threatened them with beheading if they didn't produce the names of the Freedom Brigadiers. The citizenry, who were upset about their taxes but not <i>that</i> upset, coughed up the identities like phlegm. Better to live poor than die with a few extra coins in your pocket. </p><p> Granite then rounded up the Freedom Brigade. What a great bloody row. The noise, the screaming...it was horrific. They captured almost all of them, and -- truth to tell -- the Brigadiers didn't exactly conduct themselves as heroes. Playing at being freedom fighters, criticizing the king from a distance, declaring that taxes would not be forthcoming and that the king should take his best shot at collecting them -- these are all well and good in the abstract. Faced with a sword to your throat, however, your priorities tend to shift. Rhetoric takes a second chair to saving your own skin. My understanding is that they begged, pleaded for their lives. They wept, they entreated, they soi...</p></p><h2>Christian Community Bible: Catholic Pastoral Edition</h2><p>The Christian Community Bible was begun in 1960 in Chile when Rev. Bernardo Hurault decided that a Bible that can be understood by ordinary poor people is needed, and that this Bible should include commentaries to help its readers understand it. He began translating from Hebrew and Greek to Spanish, incorporating his own homilies and questions from his own congregation as commentaries. The finished translation, known as la Biblia Latinoamericana, was published in 1971. The English translation was produced in 1986 when Rev. Alberto Rossa, a Claretian missionary in the Philippines, saw the need for an English version of the Biblia Latinoam�ricana. Translation was finished in 18 months, and the finished translation was published in 1988 under the name Christian Community Bible. The Christian Community Bible has been since then translated into French, Filipino, Chinese, Cebuano, and Ilonggo. Other translations, also coordinated by Fr. Bernardo Hurault, are in process. The editors are engaged in a constant process of revision and improvement of the translations and commentaries always making it relevant with the latest developments in biblical scholarship and with the real situations of the people. There have been more than one hundred fifty editions in different languages of the Christian Community Bible and many millions of copies distributed which have helped the faithful in many local churches to understand and assimilate better the Word of God.</p><p></p><h2>Dead in Their Tracks: Crossing America&#39;s Desert Borderlands</h2><p>In one of the hottest, loneliest spots on earth, John Annerino hooked up with four Mexican nationals determined to cross the border illegally.

Gravity, weight, sorrow, suffering--all of this the princess misses, but with all of these she misses love, for what is love without weight, without body? What is love without falling? She discovers this truth, of course, only at the last minute when a faithful prince loves her enough to die for her. <p> Sometimes it's not a ponderous lecture--or sermon--that we need in order to experience what incarnation is about. <i>--Doug Thorpe</i>.</p><b>George MacDonald</b> (10 December 1824 &#x2013; 18 September 1905) was a Scottish author, poet, and Christian minister. He was a pioneering figure in the field of fantasy literature and the mentor of fellow writer Lewis Carroll. His writings have been cited as a major literary influence by many notable authors including W. H. Auden, C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien, Walter de la Mare, E. Nesbit and Madeleine L'Engle. C. S. Lewis wrote that he regarded MacDonald as his "master": "Picking up a copy of Phantastes one day at a train-station bookstall, I began to read. A few hours later," said Lewis, "I knew that I had crossed a great frontier." G. K. Chesterton cited <i>The Princess and the Goblin</i> as a book that had "made a difference to my whole existence".</p><h2>The Inner Life of Animals: Surprising Observations of a Hidden World</h2><p>Mother deer that grieve? Horses that feel shame? Squirrels that adopt their grandchildren? We humans tend to assume that we are the only living things able to experience feelings intensely and consciously. But have you ever wondered what&#39;s going on in an animal&#39;s head? More and more researchers are realising that animals in fact experience a rich emotional life. Acting as our interpreter of the animal world and of the fascinating science, Peter Wohlleben brings this new research to life with his own observations of his favourite creatures. From the leafy forest floor to the inside of a bee hive, The Inner Life of Animals shows us microscopic levels of observation as well as forcing us to confront the big philosophical, ethical and scientific questions. We hear the stories of a grateful humpback whale, of a hedgehog who has nightmares, and of a magpie who commits adultery; we meet bees that plan for the future, pigs who learn their own names and crows that go tobogganing for fun. And at last we find out why wasps exist. Our fellow creatures are not mindless automatons driven by an inflexible genetic code, but individuals with personality and feeling. The Inner Life of Animals will show you these living things in a new light and will open up the animal kingdom like never before.</p><p>Peter Wohlleben spent over twenty years working for the forestry commission in Germany before leaving to put his ideas of ecology into practice. He now runs an environmentally-friendly woodland in Germany, where he is working towards the return of primeval forests, as well as caring for both wild and domestic animals. Wohlleben has been celebrated for his distinctive approach to writing about nature; he brings to life groundbreaking scientific research through his observations of nature and the animals he lives amongst. He is also the author of the international bestseller The Hidden Life of Trees.&#34;Always fascinating... Wry, avuncular, careful and kind, Wohlleben guides us from one creature to the next&#34; -- Richard Kerridge * Guardian * &#34;Wohlleben presents short chapter in bite-sized portions, so the reader has a constant sense of learning something new almost with every page ... The formula is provably winning. I still felt I was on a robust learning curve as subjects as diverse as motherly love, gratitude, deception, desire, shame and knowledge of good and evil were explored one by one ... fascinating&#34; -- Katharine Norbury * Observer * &#34;Wohlleben is connecting with something big here... He truffles up some wonderful animal facts, too... Wohlleben&#39;s empathy with animals can be touching and illuminating&#34; -- James McConnachie * Sunday Times * &#34;Entertaining and enthusiastic&#34; -- Tim Smith-Laing * Daily Telegraph * &#34;The Inner Life of Animals will rock your world. Surprising, humbling, and filled with delight, this book shows us that animals think, feel, and know in much the same way as we do -- and that their lives are, to them, as precious as ours are to us.&#34; -- Sy Montgomery, author of THE SOUL OF AN OCTOPUS</p><h2>Knopf City Guide: Lisbon (Knopf City Guides)</h2><p>These striking new guides to seven major destinations are so appealing that you won't be able to put them down--even after you've stopped traveling.

He died in 2009.Chapter One <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>The hostler at the Two Forks Livery &amp; Grain paused in his listless pitching of hay as he saw two riders move down from the crest of the limestone hill. Harley Mills rubbed a sleeve over his sweat-streaked face and speculated as to whether he was fixing to get some customers. Hot as it was, and seeing as the stable didn't belong to him, he had as soon not have business get out of hand. It hadn't lately. With this drought on, people were playing it close to their belts. They weren't coming to town when they didn't have to, because money was tight. He went back to his halfhearted efforts until one of the horses in the corral thrust its head over the top plank and nickered. An answer came from out on the road. Mills put the hayfork aside and stepped through the gate. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>The two men were strangers to him. "Mornin'," he said. "From the looks of the dust on you, you've come a ways. I expect them horses could stand a feed." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>No one replied. The hostler stared a moment at a rust-bearded man hunched on a streak-faced bay, then his reddish eyes were drawn to the taller rider, a gaunt, sallow-faced man who studied him in dark distrust. The hostler felt a sudden misgiving and wished they had passed him by. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>The man said, "You're Harley Mills." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>The hostler swallowed, puzzled. "That's right. But I don't know you. Or do I?" <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>The rider said, "You didn't used to swamp stables. Time I remember you, you was cowboyin' for old man Blair Bishop." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>"Used to. He fired&#x2014;we come to a partin', years ago." Harley Mills searched the seldom-explored recesses of his whiskey-dimmed memory. Something in those deep-set black eyes reached him. His jaw dropped. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>The rider responded with a hard grin. "Know me now, don't you?" <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Mills nodded, dry-mouthed and nervous. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>The tall man said evenly, "Then I reckon we'll leave these horses with you. Me and Owen, we're goin' to go wash some of the dust down. You take good care of them now, Harley, you hear? Good care." Mills could only nod. The tall rider swung to the hoof-scuffed ground and shoved the leather reins into Mills' numb hands. He reached back to his warbag tied behind the saddle and fetched out a cartridge belt. He took his time putting it on while the hostler stared at the .45 in fearful fascination. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>The man asked, "Things ain't changed much in ten years, have they?" Mills shook his head, a knot in his throat. The rider queried, "Blair Bishop still figurin' hisself the big he-coon?" The hostler's eyes gave him the answer and he added, "Well, things can't stay the same forever. Come on, Owen, we're past due for that drink." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Harley Mills barely glanced at the red-bearded Owen as he took the second set of reins. He watched the tall man stride up the street, looking at first one side of it, then the other. Mills led the horses into the corral, slipped the saddles and bridles off and gave the mounts a good bait of oats. His fingers touched a saddlegun in a scabbard as he swung the tall man's saddle onto a rack, and he jerked his hand back as if he had touched a hot stove. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Done, he shut the corral gate behind him and struck a stiff trot up the street to the court house. He almost ran down the county clerk as he rushed through the hall and into the door of the sheriff's office. He gestured excitedly at the graying ex-cowboy who looked up startled from his paperwork. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>"It's Macy Modock," he blurted, gasping for breath. "Macy Modock is back in town." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>The sheriff poked his head through the door of the Two Forks Bar &amp; Billiard Emporium. Looking around quickly, he spotted the two men seated at a small table. He stared a moment, his heavy fingers gripping the doorjamb. At length the tall man spoke to him. "Come on in, Erly. Wondered how long it would take you." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Sheriff Erly Greenwood moved solemnly, his sun-browned face pinched into a frown. He halted two paces from the table, gave the red-bearded man a quick glance, then gazed at the other. "What you doin' here, Macy?" <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>"Havin' a drink. Share a little sunshine with us?" <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>"You was in the pen, Macy. How come you out?" <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>"I was turned out. Got all the proper papers right here in my pocket." He tapped his shirt. "Care to look?" <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>The sheriff nodded. "Maybe I better." His frown deepened, and his moustache worked a little as he read. "You didn't serve out all the term they gave you." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>"Good behavior, Erly. Surprise you I could behave myself?" <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>"Damn sure does. I figured you'd get in a fight and some other prisoner would stomp your brains out. Hoped so, as a matter of fact." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>"But here I am back in Two Forks, like a bad penny." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>"I want you out, Macy. Have your drink, get your horses fed, then ride on out. I don't want to ever see you again . . . not in this town, not in this country." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Macy Modock studied his half-finished drink, a little anger flaring before he quickly forced it back. "Erly, if you'll read that paper a little closer you'll see it says I done paid up all I owe. I can come and go as I please, here or anywhere else. And after all, I'm a property owner in Two Forks. I come to see about my property." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>"After ten years? That old saloon you had is half fallen in. Kids broke out all the windowlights the first week you was gone. Wind took off most of the shingles, and rain has done the rest." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>"The land it sets on is mine. I come to see after my property. There can't nobody quarrel over that." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Erly Greenwood shifted his weight from one foot to the other. His jaw worked, but it was a while before any words came out. "Macy, we've had a nice quiet town here the last few years." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Modock nodded. "You're puttin' on some belly." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>"Just you listen to what I tell you. If you've come to settle up any old scores, I won't have it." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>A hard smile came to Macy Modock's thin, cheek-sunken face. "I got no grudge against you, Erly. You just done what you was told. The boss man snapped his fingers and you jumped. That's how it always was, them days. He still snappin' his fingers, Erly?" <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Anger leaped into Erly Greenwood's face. "He's a good man, Macy. Anything he done to you, he done for good cause. If you've come back to raise hell . . ." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Macy Modock glanced at his red-whiskered companion. "Like I told you, Owen, things ain't really changed. The years go by, people get older, but everything else stays the same." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>The sheriff's voice carried an edge. "I want you out of here." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>"When I get ready. Who knows? I might take a notion to rebuild." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Conviction came to Erly Greenwood. "You've come to get even with him, Macy. Don't you try." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Modock grunted. "You was just a cowboy when Blair Bishop had that badge pinned on you. You're still just a cowboy." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>"That's a matter of opinion. Don't you crowd me." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Modock stared at him coldly. "If there's trouble between me and Blair Bishop, it'll be when he comes huntin' me, not me huntin' him." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Macy Modock turned away from the sheriff. He poured himself a fresh drink and held it in his hand, admiring the amber color as if he had dismissed the sheriff from his mind. Greenwood turned on his heel and left. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>The smile came back slowly to Modock's line-creased mouth. "And Blair Bishop will come huntin' me, Owen. I'll make him hunt me. And when I shoot him in self-defense, not even a Two Forks jury can touch me." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Excerpted from Shotgun by Elmer KeltonCopyright � 1969 by Coronet Communications, Inc.Published in June 2009 by Tom Doherty Associates, LLC <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>All rights reserved.

Wang Hui argues that current models, based largely on Western notions of empire and the nation-state, fail to account for the richness and diversity of pre-modern Chinese historical practice. At the same time, he refrains from offering an exclusively Chinese perspective and placing China in an intellectual ghetto. Navigating terrain on regional language and politics, he draws on China&#x2019;s unique past to expose the inadequacies of European-born standards for assessing modern China&#x2019;s evolution. He takes issue particularly with the way in which nation-state logic has dominated politically charged concerns like Chinese language standardization and &#x201c;The Tibetan Question.&#x201d; His stance is critical&#x2015;and often controversial&#x2015;but he locates hope in the kinds of complex, multifaceted arrangements that defined China and much of Asia for centuries.</p><p><i>The Politics of Imagining Asia</i> challenges us not only to re-examine our theories of &#x201c;Asia&#x201d; but to reconsider what &#x201c;Europe&#x201d; means as well. As Theodore Huters writes in his introduction, &#x201c;Wang Hui&#x2019;s concerns extend beyond China and Asia to an ambition to rethink world history as a whole.&#x201d;</p></p><p><p>Wang Hui is Professor of Literature and History at Tsinghua University in Beijing.</p><p>Theodore Huters is Professor Emeritus of Chinese in the Department of Asian Languages and Cultures at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p>&#x201c;In these groundbreaking essays, Wang Hui questions the reigning paradigms of Chinese studies and China watching, tracing them to their historical and intellectual roots Delineating alternative concepts and practices in Chinese thought and history, Wang seeks not to assert a Chinese difference against universal paradigms but rather to articulate Chinese pursuits of modernity as both unique and brimming with world-historical significance. These essays are indispensable guides for anyone willing to rethink the inherited modes of inquiry about China.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Ban Wang, Stanford University</b><br><br>&#x201c;This collection of Wang Hui's essays is valuable reading for Westerners who want to understand what China's emergence might mean beyond strictly economic terms. A book that deserves attention now.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>James Fallows, National Correspondent for The Atlantic</b><br><br>&#x201c;A powerful thinker! Wang Hui, China's foremost humanistic scholar, offers a bold and well-grounded critique of the familiar narrative woven between "Asia" and "world history." His broad vision and sharp analysis unravel the logic of modernity and its many contradictions to demonstrate how the meaning of the political has never ceased to morph in recent history and why we must fundamentally rethink its relationship to the nation-state, empire, and capitalism for the twenty-first century.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Lydia H. Liu, author of <i>The Clash of Empires: The Invention of China in Modern World Making</i> (2004)</b><br><br>&#x201c;This fascinating book gives general readers, historians and political theorists a way of rediscovering China's valuable revolutionary heritage. Wang Hui destabilizes what 'Asia's' has meant in earlier history writing, and the 1930s 'Kyoto School' acts as his foil as he seeks a new starting point for thinking of Asian regionalism, Chinese language politics, international utopian socialism, and the prehistory of Tibetan-Chinese relations as possible optimistic alternatives to state developmentalism.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Tani Barlow, Rice University</b><br><br>&#x201c;Wang Hui is widely known as one of China's most prominent intellectual historians. He has stirred controversies and has strongly criticized the nation-state-centered and technology-driven paradigm that has dominated recent Chinese thought. But unlike others, Wang Hui has also kept his distance from Orientalist and liberal denunciations of modern China. In this book, he argues--passionately and with immense erudition--for imagining Asia outside 'national forms.' His essay on Tibet, in particular, is highly original and provocative.<br>This is a stellar contribution to postcolonial scholarship.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Partha Chatterjee, Columbia University</b><br><br>&#x201c;Written by one of the most noted, as well as controversial, Chinese scholars, this anthology offers a unique opportunity for China watchers around the world to peek into and appreciate the complex intellectual world of contemporary China...The book is quite valuable for understanding the nuances of nationalist thinking in today's China.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Q.

Drawing on primary documents he explains how the US government and the public wanted to hone bombing into a precise and effective instrument to end wars quickly with the fewest number of civilian casualties, and how the famous Nordon bombsight contributed to most of the destruction of military and industrial targets in Japan and Germany during World War II. Annotation copyright Book News, Inc. Portland, Or.</p><p>Stephen L. McFarland is an associate professor of history at Auburn University.The major lesson to emerge from WWI in connection with aerial bombing was the need for greater accuracy. This excellent scholarly study traces the interwar development of an aiming device that would enable airmen to drop bombs where they wanted them to go, then details that device's role in the American bombing campaigns of WWII. Essentially, this is the history of the legendary Norden bombsight, the technological centerpiece of the world's most precise bombing system. McFarland (coauthor with Wesley Phillips Newton of To Command the Sky) recounts America's unpreparedness for mass production of Carl Norden's brilliant invention, then how the military-industrial complex got it in working gear. He also covers the training of bombardiers in the attempt to achieve precision bombing during the war. Finally, he reviews the bombing campaigns against Germany and Japan, focusing on the switch to incendiary raids against the latter, a strategy "based on killing people rather than blowing up industries."

There are a couple good bars in town, though, if you don&#x2019;t mind country music.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I hate it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Six and a half hours,&#x201d; Baker said as Singewald eased the Chevy onto the on-ramp and joined the flow of traffic north.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p><b>IT WAS A CLEAR</b> summer morning in mid-August. The mountains to the west shimmered through early-hour smog that would lift and dissipate when the temperature rose into the seventies. Both men wore ties and sport coats, and in the backseat was a valise containing the legal documents they were to deliver. Both had packed a single change of clothing for the drive back the next day.</p><p>Tim Singewald had thin sandy hair, small eyes, a sallow complexion, and a translucent mustache. Lenox Baker was fifteen years younger. Singewald didn&#x2019;t know him well at all, although his impression of his colleague was that he was overeager. Baker was dark and compact and exhibited nervous energy and a wide-eyed expression he displayed when talking with a senior staffer that said, <i>Keep me in mind when promotions or transfers come along.</i></p><p>Singewald noticed that Baker wore a wedding band, but he&#x2019;d never heard the wife&#x2019;s name. Singewald had been divorced for six years.</p><p>All he knew about Baker was, like thousands of others across the country, he was new to the agency and he was gung-ho to get into some kind of action.</p><p>Baker was an EPA Special Agent (Grade 12), one of 350-plus and growing. He pulled in $93,539 a year in salary plus benefits and hoped to move up to Grade 15, where Singewald resided. Singewald made $154,615 per year, plus benefits.</p><p>As they cleared Metro Denver into Broomfield, Singewald reached up with his left hand and loosened the knot on his tie and then pulled it free and stuffed it into his jacket pocket. When Baker saw him do it, he reached up and did the same.</p><p>&#x201c;Ties stand out where we&#x2019;re going,&#x201d; Singewald said.</p><p>&#x201c;What do they wear? Clip-ons? String ties?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They don&#x2019;t wear ties,&#x201d; Singewald said. &#x201c;They wear jeans with belts that say &#x2018;Hoss.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>Baker laughed. Then: &#x201c;Who is this guy we have to pick up in Cheyenne?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Somebody with the U.S. Corps of Engineers,&#x201d; Singewald said, shrugging. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why is he coming along?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Singewald said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t ask.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The secret to a long career,&#x201d; Baker said.</p><p>&#x201c;You got it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are there other secrets?&#x201d; Baker asked, grinning a schoolboy grin.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Singewald said, and said no more.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p><b>THE AGENTS DROVE</b> another hour north and crossed the border into Wyoming. Instantly, the car was buffeted by gusts of wind.</p><p>&#x201c;Where are the trees?&#x201d; Baker asked.</p><p>&#x201c;They blew away,&#x201d; Singewald said.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p><b>AS SINGEWALD WHEELED</b> into the parking lot of the Federal Building in Cheyenne, he saw an older man in a windbreaker and sunglasses standing near the vestibule entrance. The man was conspicuously checking his watch and glancing toward them as they found an empty spot.</p><p>&#x201c;Gotta be him,&#x201d; Singewald said.</p><p>&#x201c;What was his name again?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Love. That&#x2019;s all I know about him.&#x201d;</p><p>The man who might be Love pushed himself off the brick wall and walked slowly to their car. Singewald powered down his window.</p><p>&#x201c;You EPA?&#x201d; the man asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Agents Singewald and Baker.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Kim Love,&#x201d; the man said. &#x201c;I guess we&#x2019;re going to the same place today.&#x201d;</p><p>Singewald chinned toward the backseat. &#x201c;Do you have anything you need to put in the trunk before we leave?&#x201d;</p><p>Love rocked back on his heels and hooked his thumbs through his belt loops. He shook his head.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll follow you up,&#x201d; Love said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got my own car.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure you don&#x2019;t want to come with us?&#x201d; Singewald asked Love.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Suit yourself. Do you know where we&#x2019;re going?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, unfortunately.&#x201d;</p><p>Singewald didn&#x2019;t react. Instead, he reached inside his jacket pocket and handed Love an official EPA business card.</p><p>&#x201c;My cell phone number is on there. Give me a call when we get going so I have yours, so we can keep in touch if we get separated.&#x201d;</p><p>Love sighed and shook his head. &#x201c;What, you think you&#x2019;re entering No Man&#x2019;s Land?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Baker whispered, sotto voce.</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe we can stop in Casper for lunch,&#x201d; Love said. &#x201c;I know a place there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll follow you,&#x201d; Singewald said with a shrug.</p><p>When Love walked away to climb into his own sedan with U.S. Government plates, Baker said to Singewald, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s his problem?&#x201d;</p><p>Singewald shrugged. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t know and don&#x2019;t care,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s just another working stiff. Like us.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p><b>BAKER WAS PRACTICALLY SPUTTERING </b>two and a half hours later when the brake lights of Love&#x2019;s sedan flashed and the Corps of Engineers car took the Second Street exit in Casper and turned in at a truck stop.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s yanking our chain,&#x201d; Baker said, leaning forward in his seat to look around. A long line of side-by-side tractor-trailers idled in a cacophony on the south side of the huge parking lot. A trucker emerged from the restaurant and convenience-store doors holding a half-gallon soft-drink container to take back to his truck cab.</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe this Love knows something,&#x201d; Singewald said. &#x201c;Maybe this place is, you know, a jewel in the rough.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a <i>truck stop</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We might as well be friendly, since we&#x2019;re stuck with him,&#x201d; Singewald said, and turned off the motor.</p><p>Baker sighed. &#x201c;Maybe I&#x2019;ll just stay in here. I can feel my arteries clogging up just looking at this place and the people coming out of it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to come in,&#x201d; Singewald said, handing Baker the keys. &#x201c;If you want to listen to the radio or something.&#x201d;</p><p>Baker waved him off. &#x201c;Believe me, there&#x2019;s probably nothing worth listening to here. I&#x2019;m not a big fan of Buck Owens.&#x201d;</p><p>Singewald pocketed the keys.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, all right,&#x201d; Baker said with a groan, opening his door to get out.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p><b>THEY SAT </b>around a Formica table in a high-backed booth; Kim Love on one side and Singewald and Baker on the other. All of the other tables and booths were occupied by truck drivers and rough-looking locals who appeared as if they&#x2019;d driven into town from building sites or oil rigs. Even with their ties removed, Singewald thought the three of them stood out. Singewald thought Love seemed distant, and maybe a little hostile to them. He chalked it up to interagency rivalry and didn&#x2019;t let it bother him. There was no reason to make friends, he thought. He&#x2019;d never met Love before, and after their joint operation later that afternoon, he doubted he&#x2019;d ever see him again.</p><p>Beside him, Lenox Baker studied the plastic menu and sighed.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you recommend anything in particular?&#x201d; Baker asked Love.</p><p>&#x201c;The chicken-fried steak sandwich,&#x201d; Love said without even looking at his menu. &#x201c;Best in Central Wyoming. I&#x2019;m from Texas, and I&#x2019;m particular about chicken-fried steak. They do it right here: no pre-breaded bullshit.&#x201d;</p><p>Baker cringed.</p><p>Singewald ordered the sandwich as well, and Baker asked the waitress if the lettuce of the chef salad had any preservatives sprayed on it. Without a smile and with a quick glance toward her other busy tables, she said, &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t know that, hon.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can you ask the chef?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t have a chef. I&#x2019;ll ask the <i>cook</i>,&#x201d; she said, and spun on her heels toward the kitchen.</p><p>&#x201c;Those chemicals give me diarrhea,&#x201d; Baker explained to Singewald.</p><p>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t have that,&#x201d; he replied.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p><b>AFTER THEY PUSHED</b> their empty plates away and sat back&#x2014;Baker had picked at his salad and claimed he was full&#x2014;Love looked squarely at Singewald and said, &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t say I like what we&#x2019;re doing today.&#x201d;</p><p>Singewald shrugged. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re just the messengers.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Still.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We didn&#x2019;t make the decision,&#x201d; Singewald said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re just delivering the verdict.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Love said, shaking his head and taking a swipe at his balled-up paper napkin like a bear cub, &#x201c;I read it. In fact, I read it twice and didn&#x2019;t like it any better the second time.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t read &#x2019;em,&#x201d; Singewald said, looking over Baker&#x2019;s head in an attempt to signal the waitress. &#x201c;I just deliver &#x2019;em. Reading &#x2019;em is above my pay grade.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I hear he&#x2019;s a hardheaded man,&#x201d; Love said.</p><p>Singewald nodded.</p><p>&#x201c;I get the impression he&#x2019;s not going to just roll over.&#x201d;</p><p>Baker opened his jacket and interjected, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why we carry these,&#x201d; indicating the butt of his holstered semiautomatic&nbsp;.40 Sig Sauer.</p><p>Love&#x2019;s mouth dropped open, and he turned to Singewald. &#x201c;You guys carry <i>guns</i>?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re trained and authorized,&#x201d; Singewald said softly.</p><p>&#x201c;You should see what we have in the trunk,&#x201d; Baker said. Singewald thought of the combat shotguns and scoped semiautomatic rifles nestled in their cases.</p><p>Love&#x2019;s eyebrows arched when he said, &#x201c;So you&#x2019;re prepared to shoot it out with him if necessary?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If necessary,&#x201d; Baker said, narrowing his eyes.</p><p>&#x201c;I try not to predict these things,&#x201d; Singewald said, almost apologetically. He didn&#x2019;t want to continue this conversation. He wished Baker wasn&#x2019;t so overtly gung-ho. Then he raised his hand and waved at the waitress. He began to think she was ignoring him.</p><p>&#x201c;Have you met this guy we&#x2019;re serving the order on?&#x201d; Love asked Singewald.</p><p>&#x201c;Nope,&#x201d; Singewald said, wondering if he should snap his fingers to get her attention. &#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t there the first time he was given the word. From what I understand, he was confused, mainly. I don&#x2019;t think he&#x2019;s the sharpest knife in the drawer, so to speak.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But he sure as hell understands now,&#x201d; Love said, shaking his head. &#x201c;Things like this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it makes me wonder just what the hell we&#x2019;re doing. It isn&#x2019;t the kind of thing I signed up for, that&#x2019;s for sure.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the problem?&#x201d; Baker said suddenly to Love, his tone incredulous. &#x201c;The guy obviously screwed up big-time or we wouldn&#x2019;t be going up there. I don&#x2019;t understand what you&#x2019;re talking about.&#x201d;</p><p>Love leaned forward on the table and balled his fists together. &#x201c;Do you know him?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course not,&#x201d; Baker said, defensive.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you know anything about him?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just his address.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did <i>you</i> even read the documents we&#x2019;re taking up there?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Baker said, looking away from Love to Singewald.</p><p>The waitress intervened and slapped the bill down on the table as she rushed by.</p><p>&#x201c;Ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; Singewald said.</p><p>She turned toward him.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll need separate checks. One for him and me,&#x201d; he said, gesturing to Baker, &#x201c;and one for him,&#x201d; he nodded toward Love. &#x201c;And receipts, please.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Separate checks and receipts,&#x201d; she repeated with a dead-eyed stare.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be a minute,&#x201d; she said through gritted teeth.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay,&#x201d; Singewald said, sliding out of the booth. &#x201c;I can get it taken care of at the front counter.&#x201d;</p><p>Baker was right behind him as he walked up to the cashier, pulling out his U.S. government Visa card. When he glanced back, Kim Love was still sitting in the booth.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p><b>AN HOUR LATER,</b> sixty-seven miles north of Casper, Love caught up with them near Kaycee, Wyoming. Singewald looked up and saw the Corps sedan in his rearview mirror.</p><p>Baker saw him do it and turned his head toward the back. &#x201c;Oh, good,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Our buddy.&#x201d;</p><p>Singewald grunted.</p><p>&#x201c;What is his problem, anyway?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I guess he doesn&#x2019;t like what we&#x2019;re doing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why does he even care?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d have to ask him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I think you should mention this in our report,&#x201d; Baker said.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p><b>THE TERRAIN CHANGED</b> as they drove north. Blue humpback mountains had emerged from the prairie to the west. Lines of high white snow veined down from the summits and melded into dark timber.</p><p>Baker pointed at a cluster of vivid brown-and-white dots placed on the slow-waving high grass out his window. &#x201c;Are those pronghorns?&#x201d;</p><p>Singewald said they were.</p><p>&#x201c;And they just stand there like that? There must be a hundred of them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve heard there are more pronghorn antelope than people in this part of the state,&#x201d; Singewald said.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, at least there&#x2019;s something good about it,&#x201d; Baker said.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p><b>&#x201c;THE TETONS?&#x201d; BAKER ASKED, </b>pointing toward the mountains.</p><p>&#x201c;Bighorns,&#x201d; Singewald said. &#x201c;Those are the Bighorns.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So that&#x2019;s where we&#x2019;re going,&#x201d; Baker said, looking at the GPS display, and then his watch.</p><p>&#x201c;We should be able to get this done in time to check in to the hotel by five,&#x201d; Baker said. &#x201c;We won&#x2019;t even have to do any overtime.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the plan,&#x201d; Singewald said.</p><p>&#x201c;I hope we can find someplace decent to eat,&#x201d; Baker said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m starving.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;First things first,&#x201d; Singewald said as they took the first exit near the town of Saddlestring.

Relevant and timely, the book brings economic tools and understanding so readers can realize the fruits of their labor and participate in the American Dream. Nobody ever gave you a boost? Brodie and Wright will. You never got this course in high school? Here it is. The constant theme is to promote financial skills as a critical avenue to self reliance and personal freedom.

Whether you change your mind about MacDonald's role in the murder of his family, you will learn much about the case that puts it in a new light. For example, the army narrowed in on MacDonald as their prime suspect very early in the investigation, and discouraged the FBI from developing alternate theories. And the judge in the case, Franklin Dupree Jr. appeared to have been biased in favor of the prosecution. Janet Malcolm, the <i>New Yorker</i> writer who wrote <i>The Journalist and the Murderer</i> (about MacDonald's relationship with McGinniss), called this book "quietly convincing."Jerry Allen Potter was a novelist. He lived in Pacific Grove, California, until his death in 2004.</p><h2>Jelly Roll Quilt Magic</h2><p>The popularity of Jelly Rolls, Layer Cakes, and Turnovers hasn't waned, but the quilts made from them have begun to a look a lot alike until now! Kimberly Einmo, rising star international instructor and AQS author of Jelly Roll Quilts &amp; More (2010), introduces an entirely new design sense in this book, which really is a magical approach to using precuts. She also introduces a 'shopping list' concept to make prepping for sewing a snap. More time for creating, sewing, and quilting! 13 colorful projects give readers the opportunity to grasp her vision, and she provides block options for true originality. Last but not least, Kimberly experimented using precuts in a Round Robin exchange with international quilting friends. The idea and the results are amazing. This book will fuel quilt guild projects and challenges for years to come.</p><p>Kimberly Einmo is an author, designer, international quilting instructor, and quilt judge.

Reprint.</p><p>PreSchool-Grade 1?Bold-colored backgrounds smartly display Miller's highly textured paper assemblages, which look as though they could be plucked off the page. The paper?cut, contoured, layered, curled, and folded?has been given extra dimension through colored-pencil shadings and then effectively positioned to good effect. The text, a boy's recitation of the 12-plus reasons for not saying boo to a goose, includes "I'd dance with a pig in a shining green wig" and "I'd feed my pajamas to giant piranhas" and will have children quickly chiming in on the repeating line?"But I wouldn't say 'boo' to a goose." Readers will have to wait until the last page to find out why. In the classroom, this book could provide a model for youngsters to write additional lines of their own. Joseph Low's Boo to a Goose (Scribners, 1975; o.p.), a story about a boy who overcomes his fear of a mean old goose, will make a nice companion story.?Barbara Elleman, Marquette University, Milwaukee, WI<br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.Something is troubling the narrator of Fox's tale: ``I'd ride on a 'roo to Kalamazoo but I wouldn't say `Boo!' to a goose.'' He'd ``play with a snake'' if he found one awake, and he'd feed his pajamas to giant piranhas, but he ``wouldn't say `Boo!' to a goose.'' The rhymes are whimsical--he'd also ``gobble up snails from smelly old pails''--while Miller's three-dimensional, cut-paper collages are startlingly real. The piranhas sport menacing teeth, the trees that cling to a hillside look as if readers could climb them, and the butter that is consumed on the way to Calcutta is a mountain of individual golden slices. In words and art, a delightful mix of nonsense and verve. (Picture book. 4-8) -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Collected Poems offers the first full portrait of Ceravolo&#39;s aesthetic trajectory, bringing to light the highly original voice that was operating at an increasing remove from the currents of the time. From a poetics associated with Frank O&#39;Hara and John Ashbery to an ever more contemplative, deeply visionary poetics similar in sensibility to Zen and Dante, William Blake and St. John of the Cross, this collection shows how Ceravolo&#39;s poetry takes on a direct, quiet lyricism: intensely dedicated to the natural and spiritual life of the individual. As Ron Silliman notes, Ceravolo&#39;s later work reveals him to be &#34;one of the most emotionally open, vulnerable and self-knowing poets of his generation.&#34; Many new pieces, including the masterful long poem &#34;The Hellgate,&#34; are published here for the first time. This volume is a landmark edition for American poetry, and includes an introduction by David Lehman.</p><p>JOSEPH CERAVOLO (1934&#x2013;;1988) was a poet and civil engineer who was born in Astoria, Queens, and lived in New Jersey. He was the author of six books of poetry and won the first Frank O'Hara Award. ROSEMARY CERAVOLO is an artist, novelist, and art critic. She lives in Bloomfield, New Jersey. PARKER SMATHERS is a poet and editor at Wesleyan University Press. DAVID LEHMAN is a poet and the series editor for The Best American Poetry series. He teaches at The New School."Collected Poems proves James Wright to be a truly rare and beautiful poet . . . [It] has the authority that only the best books have; it forces on us the recognition that Wright is among the masters of our day."&#x2015;Peter S. Stitt, <i>New York Times Book Review</i><p>"Joseph Ceravolo's poetry, like the very best poetry, is at once timeless and contemporary, magical and truthful, visionary and real. One never ceases to be moved and astonished by his highly original poetics. His work is always revelatory. Always."&#x2015;Peter Gizzi</p><p>"In much of his work, he seems to be on an almost religious pilgrimage, moving away from the center of his life and family, then back again. As readers, we want him to enjoy the pleasures of his life, but we realize that if he had, we would be denied the complexity of his poetry. One can only wish that he had lived longer to express more of what his incredible talent had promised."&#x2015;Douglas Messerli, <i>HYPERALLERGIC</i></p><p>"The editors of the Collected Poems, Rosemary Ceravolo and Parker Smathers, have made a wise choice here to arrange the poet's books chronologically rather than by publication date. This decision allows readers to develop a more sophisticated view of Ceravolo's evolution as a poet. Work such as Ceravolo's bucked the Eastern spirituality trend in the 1960s and 70s, exemplified by poets such as Allen Ginsberg and Anne Waldman, and the founding of the Naropa Institute in 1974. From Transmigration Solo to Mad Angels Ceravolo kept returning to life and spirit. He married, had a family, engineered roads, and wrote poems, all these more or less the concerns of his life. These concerns cause Ceravolo to stand a bit apart from New York School compatriots such as Ted Berrigan and Ron Padgett. As word of Cervolo's work spreads, thanks to the publication of the Collected Poems, it will be interesting to see how much the poet's spiritual concerns matter to his readers when so much of what has drawn readers in over the years is his playful disregard for typical syntax and the feeling that Ceravolo could say anything and it would sound wonderful. For this reader, the poet cannot be broken into parts. Without spirit one cannot have the concerns of life."&#x2015;<i>Zoland Poetry</i></p><p>"Possibly the New York School's biggest secret&#x2015;because the publicity-shy poet died young&#x2015;is Joseph Ceravolo. His poetry is wonderful, it is distinctive, in some ways it seems anomalous in the New York context."&#x2015;David Lehman, <i>Best American Poetry Blog</i></p><p>"To read the poems of Joseph Ceravolo is to stride in radiance and through a coronal of colors, all of them tender. And yet his tenderness and the purity of his vision are not fragile, not ephemeral. Ceravolo is the strongest of American poets, the Villon of our apocalypse. His color is words, but his shape is the shape of action."&#x2015;Donald Revell, author of Pennyweight Windows: New &amp; Selected Poems</p><p>"Ceravolo transcends the canon(his) verse is at once classical and fresh, tender and profound, succinct and expansive, tantalizingly parseable yet divinely ineffable. It would take a lifetime of expert reading to fully appreciate this lifetime of superlative writing; with the long-awaited publication of a collected Ceravolo, America's contemporary poetry readers now have the opportunity to do their part."&#x2015;Seth Abramson, <i>Huffington Post</i></p><p>"Fascinating, unwieldy, and sometimes sublime, this first collected for the New Jersey&#x2013;based Ceravolo (1934-88) reveals a poet wilder&#x2015;and potentially far more popular&#x2015;than the one all but a few strong admirers know.This big book will spark new interest; it might even attract fans of Rumi, or of the Beats."&#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>"We're getting nervous and shaky just thinking about it&#x2013;unless that's the overcoffee&#x2013;no, no, it's all due to the forthcoming Collected Poems"&#x2015;<i>Harriet, the Poetry Foundation Blog</i></p><p>"'The overlooked genius of American poetry,' as David Lethem states in the introduction, Ceravolo (1934&#x2013;88) emerges from the opening poems of his first book, Fits of Dawn (1965), as speech churns sound and meaning goes 'round and 'round&#x2015;'Mounting!/ O dive! song song restay fairness of/ dawn.

Each one needs, for its functioning and integrity, a trace of a mineral called selenium. The odds are that you aren&#39;t getting enough of it in your diet. Yet there is, incredibly, official controversy over whether humans need this substance! In this new work on the subject Dr. Passwater lays out the full story of how selenium works, what therapy employing it has accomplished - and, most importantly, how you can assure yourself of your body&#39;s needed supply of this vital element.</p><p></p><h2>The Great Escape</h2><p>One of the most famous true stories from the last war, The GREAT ESCAPE tells how more than six hundred men in a German prisoner-of-war camp worked together to achieve an extraordinary break-out. Every night for a year they dug tunnels, and those who weren&#39;t digging forged passports, drew maps, faked weapons and tailored German uniforms and civilian clothes to wear once they had escaped. All of this was conducted under the very noses of their prison guards. When the right night came, the actual escape itself was timed to the split second - but of course, not everything went according to plan...</p><p>With only their bare hands and the crudest of homemade tools, they sank shafts, built underground railroads, forged passports, drew maps, faked weapons, and tailored German uniforms and civilian clothes.<br><br>They developed a fantastic security system to protect themselves from the German "ferrets" who prowled the compounds with nerve-racking tenacity and suspicion.<br><br>It was a split-second operation as delicate and as deadly as a time bomb. It demanded the concentrated devotion and vigilance of more than six hundred men -- every single one of them, every minute, every hour, every day, and every night for more than a year.During the war Paul Brickhill was shot down over German territory and sent to a prisoner of war camp. After the war he wrote about the numerous escape attempts in which he was involved in THE GREAT ESCAPE. REACH FOR THE SKY, and THE DAMBUSTERS RAID are his most famous works.</p><h2>A Soldier&#39;s Revenge: A Will Cochrane Novel</h2><p><p>Former intelligence agent Will Cochrane must evade US authorities hunting him down for a murder he didn&#x2019;t commit in this captivating sixth entry in the acclaimed action-thriller series.</p><p>Former operative Will Cochrane wakes up in New York&#x2019;s Waldorf Astoria and is horrified to see blood on his hands&#x2014;something he remembers absolutely nothing about.

Determined to discover the truth, Pix is drawn into a suspenseful world of intrigue, stolen antiques, secret histories, and deadly echoes from Norway's past and the Nazi occupation.

Here, Pix's own mother, Ursala Rowe, has had a call for help from her old friend Marit Hansen, longtime resident in Norway: Marit's granddaughter Kari has vanished after the drowning death of her fianc&#x201a;e Erik. The two had left their jobs as guides on a Scandie Sights tour, supposedly to elope. In short order, Ursala and Pix are on their way to Norway to join the ongoing tour and help Marit find her granddaughter. As the tour group moves from town to town and fjord to fjord, Pix and Ursala cross-question the other travelers, mostly American, and the current guides Carl and Jan, finding out little but provoking someone to lock Pix in a sauna. It's also her misfortune to discover the body of Oscar Melling, an obnoxious New Jerseyite, who's been killed in a seemingly accidental fall. The huge swastika painted overnight on the front lawn of one hotel is bad enough, evoking connections to the country's Quisling past, but it takes the kidnapping, imprisonment, and eventual escape of our heroine to accomplish the trip's mission. Masses of tourist-guide information; lots of inane chitchat; an endless parade of food and drink (recipes included), and a string of common-sensedefying plot developments: all make, together, an uncompelling, often tedious outing.

A dramatic narration of one of the most colorful chapters of the cultural collision that thrust Europeans into Indian America.</p><p>"It is a magnificent epic," said William H. Prescott after the publication of "History of the Conquest of Mexico in 1843. Since then, his sweeping account of Cortes's subjugation of the Aztec people has endured as a landmark work of scholarship and dramatic storytelling. This pioneering study presents a compelling view of the clash of civilizations that reverberates in Latin America to this day. <br>"Regarded simply from the standpoint of literary criticism, the "Conquest of Mexico is Prescott's masterpiece," judged his biographer Harry Thurston Peck. "More than that, it is one of the most brilliant examples which the English language possesses of literary art applied to historical narration. . . . Here, as nowhere else, has Prescott succeeded in delineating character. All the chief actors of his great historic drama not only live and breathe, but they are as distinctly differentiated as they must have been in life. Cortes and his lieutenants are persons whom we actually come to know in the pages of Pres-cott. . . . Over against these brilliant figures stands the melancholy form of Montezuma, around whom, even from the first, one feels gathering the darkness of his coming fate. He reminds one of some hero of Greek tragedy, doomed to destruction and intensely conscious of it, yet striving in vain against the decree of an inexorable destiny. . . . [Prescott] transmuted the acquisitions of laborious research into an enduring monument of pure literature." <p>"From the eBook edition.</p>Prescott was from a prosperous, old New England family. In 1811 he entered Harvard, where his academic record was good but undistinguished; he had serious difficulties with mathematics, and in later life the prospect of appraising the mathematical achievements of the aboriginal Mexicans almost prevented him from completing his work. Near the end of his junior year, a crust of bread thrown during a melee in the student commons caused virtual blindness in his left eye; the weakness of his other eye, caused by infection, sometimes prevented him from carrying on any kind of literary work. Throughout his life, Prescott&#39;s vision seems to have fluctuated from good to total blindness, and he often resorted to the use of a noctograph, a writing grid with parallel wires that guided a stylus over a chemically treated surface. Substantial portions of all his books and correspondence were composed on this device. He died in 1859.</p><h2>Roy Stryker: U.S.A., 1943-1950</h2><p>Photographs show rural and urban communities, farmers and other workers, highways, railroads, church groups and families</p><p></p><h2>Biggest Bear</h2><p>Johnny Orchard brings home a playful bear cub that soon becomes huge and a nuisance to the neighbors.</p><p><br>LYND WARD (1905-1985) illustrated more than two hundred books for children and adults throughout his prolific career.

When <i>Kirkus&nbsp;&nbsp;Reviews</i> greeted Mary Willis Walker's last book,&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The Red Scream,</i> with "welcome&nbsp;&nbsp;to the big time," they weren't kidding. That&nbsp;&nbsp;novel established Walker as an author with&nbsp;&nbsp;"the kind of clout that sets publishers' mouths&nbsp;&nbsp;watering" (<i>The Philadelphia&nbsp;&nbsp;Inquirer</i>). And now she has done it again, with an&nbsp;&nbsp;unforgettable tale ripped from the headlines and&nbsp;&nbsp;more terrifying than our worst nightmares. Kidnapped&nbsp;&nbsp;by a cult of religious fanatics, an Austin school&nbsp;&nbsp;bus driver and eleven of his young charges have&nbsp;&nbsp;been held underground at the group's highly&nbsp;&nbsp;fortified compound for forty-six days.

Tough, terrifying, and relentlessly&nbsp;&nbsp;heart-wrenching, this is a novel whose images no reader will&nbsp;&nbsp;ever forget.<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><p>Mary Willis Walker won an Agatha for her first novel (which was also nominated for the Macavity and the Edgar) and the prestigious Edgar with her second, THE RED SCREAM. She lives in Austin, Texas.This psychological thriller will chill the listener to the bone. A group of fanatical, right-wing religious extremists kidnaps 11 children and their bus driver. Reporter Molly Cates races against time to find and rescue them. Judith Ivey performs this story with an incredible number of voices and accents, each carefully crafted for the appropriate character. Samuel Mordecai, the fanatics&#39; leader, is particular strident. Ivey captures the New York City and Hispanic accents as easily as the Southern Texas twangs. Music dramatizes the performance and the horror of the situation. The story line is disturbing, but the performance is worthy of the best suspense novel. M.B.K.

As a student she developed a deep interest in the theater, both modern drama and traditional Kabuki, and her own plays are widely performed in Japan. Many of her novels have also been adapted for the stage, the cinema, and television. <p>Ariyoshi first rose to prominence in the 1950s as a writer of short stories, but has since built an impressive reputation as a novelist dealing with crucial social issues. Among her themes have been the problems faced by women in the traditional Japanese household (Hanaoka seishu no tsuma, 1967, translated as "The Doctor's Wife"), racial segregation in the United States (Hishoku, 1964), and environmental pollution (Fukugo- osen, 1975). Her Kokotsu no hito (The Twilight Years) was published in 1972 and sold over a million copies in less than a year. </p><p>Translations of her books have appeared throughout the world and include a French translation of The Doctor's Wife, which was a bestseller in France in 1981; The River Ki; The Twilight Years; Her Highness Princess Kazu, awarded the prestigious Mainichi Cultural Prize in 1979; and Kabuki Dancer. </p><p>Ariyoshi died in 1984.</p></p><h2>Garry Kasparov on Modern Chess, Part 2: Kasparov Vs Karpov 1975-1985</h2><p><p>The history of sport has seen many great gladiatorial clashes: Ali v Frazier in boxing, McEnroe v Borg in tennis, Prost v Senna in motor racing. None however can quite compare to the intensity of the rivalry between those two great world chess champions: Garry Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov. Between 1984 and 1990 they contested an astonishing five World Championship matches consisting of 144 individual encounters. This volume concentrates on the first two of those matches.</p><p> </p><p> * The epic 1984/85 contest which was lasted six months before being controversially halted &#x201c;without result&#x201d; by the then President of FIDE Florencio Campomanes.</p><p> </p><p>* The 1985 match when Kasparov brilliantly won the final game to take the title and become &#x2013; at the age of 22 &#x2013; the youngest ever world champion.</p><p> </p><p>Great chess contests have often had resonances extending beyond the 64 squares. The Fischer v Spassky match was played during the Cold War with both champions being perceived as the finest products of their respective ideologies. The Karpov v Korchnoi battles (three matches between 1974 and 1981) were lent an edge with Karpov being a Russian hero of the pre-Glasnost era whilst Korchnoi was the disaffected dissident. The Kasparov v Karpov encounters mirrored a battle between the new Russia and old Russia with Kasparov seen as a symbol of the new ideology emerging under Gorbachev whereas Karpov was seen to represent the old regime of die-hard Communists such as Brezhnev.</p><p> </p><p>In this volume Garry Kasparov (world champion between 1985 and 2000 and generally regarded as the greatest player ever) analyses in depth the clashes from 1984 and 1985, giving his opinions both on the political machinations surrounding the matches as well as the games themselves.</p></p><p><p><strong>Garry Kasparov</strong> is generally regarded as the greatest chess player ever. He was the thirteenth World Champion, holding the title between 1985 and 2000. His tournament record is second to none, featuring numerous wins in the world's major events, often by substantial margins. As well as his outstanding successes, Kasparov has constantly promoted the game; he has done more than anyone to popularise chess in modern times.</p></p><h2>I&#39;m My Daddy I&#39;m My Mommy (Sesame Street)</h2><p>Two stories explore the trials, tribulations, and fun of being a parent from the point of view of a mother and father.</p><p></p><h2>I Quit!: Stop Pretending Everything is Fine and Change You Life</h2><p>Geri Scazzero knew there was something desperately wrong with how they were doing their life and ministry. She finally told her husband, &#39;I quit,&#39; and left the thriving church he pastored, beginning a journey that transformed her, her marriage, and her church. Geri quit being afraid of what others think. She quit lying. She quit denying her anger and sadness. She quit living someone else&#39;s life. I Quit provides you a way out of an inauthentic, superficial spirituality to genuine freedom in Christ. I Quit is for every person who thinks, &#39;I can&#39;t keep pretending everything is fine!&#39; Biblical quitting goes hand in hand with choosing. When we quit those things that are damaging to our souls or the souls of others, we are freed up to choose other ways of being and relating that are rooted in love and lead to life. When we quit fear of what others think, we choose freedom. When we quit lies, we choose truth. When we quit blaming, we choose to take responsibility. When we quit faulty thinking, we choose to live in reality. When we quit for the right reasons, quitting changes us. Something breaks inside of us when we finally say, &#39;No more.&#39; But it must be done for the right reasons, at the right time, and in the right way. That&#39;s what this book is about.</p><p>Geri Scazzero is a teaching pastor and director of Marriage Ministry at New Life Fellowship Church in Queens, New York City, a multiracial, international church with over sixty-five countries represented. She is coauthor of The Emotionally Healthy Spirituality Workbook for small groups and also speaks regularly to pastors, leaders, and their spouses.&#34;I read Geri Scazzero&#39;s book on a day that had been particularly challenging, one of those &#34;I can&#39;t handle another thing!&#34; kind of days. I was able to listen to her wisdom without all the defensive barriers I might normally erect when I don&#39;t want to be faced with uncomfortable truth.

These began to see extensive combat in the Mediterranean in 1943. In their most famous use, the Italian battleship <i>Roma</i> was sunk by Fritz-X attack in September 1943 when Italy attempted to switch sides. The serious threat posed by these missiles led to a vigorous but little known &#x201c;Wizard War&#x201d; by the Allies to develop electronic counter-measures, the first effort of its kind. </p><p> Besides the antiship missiles, the other major category of German missiles were the air-defense missiles. Germany suffered extremely heavy losses from Allied strategic bombing attacks, and German fighter and flak defenses proved increasingly unsuccessful. As a result, the Luftwaffe began an extensive program to deploy several families of new air defense missiles to counter the bomber threat, including the Wasserfal, Schmetterling, and others. This book traces the origins of these missile program and examines their development and use in combat. With full-color illustrations and detailed explorations of the stories behind the missiles, this study offers a comprehensive overview of German guided missiles in the World War II era.</p></p><p><p><b>Steven J.

Biographer and novelist <strong>Richard Francis</strong> looks at the familiar drama with fresh eyes, grasping the true significance of this cataclysm through the personal story of Samuel Sewall, New England Puritan, Salem trial judge, antislavery agitator, defender of Native American rights, utopian theorist, campaigner against periwigs, family man, gallant wooer.</p><p>Sewall's life encompassed the tensions that faced the second-generation colonists, caught between the staunch conservatism of the Puritans and the possibilities their new world offered. Everywhere there was conflict, schism, and violence; the new Americans were pitted against the Native Americans, whose pagan ways terrified them, and a hostile mother country intent on imposing her control over the colony. Out of the struggle to maintain unity emerged the forces that drove the Salem tragedy. For the first time, Francis reveals the nature and scale of the threat the authorities believed they were facing.</p><p>Five guilt-wracked years after pronouncing judgment at the trials, Sewall walked into his church in Boston and recanted the guilty verdicts, praying for forgiveness. This extraordinary act not only proved a turning point for Sewall, it marked the moment when modern American values and attitudes came into being -- the shift from an almost medieval and allegorical view of good and evil to a respect for the mysteries of the human heart.</p><p>Drawing on Sewall's copious diaries, Francis enables us to see the early colonists not as grim ideologues but as flesh and blood idealists, striving for a new society while coming to terms with the desires and imperfections of ordinary life. Through this unsung hero of conscience, we gain access to the first lost frontier of the New World.</p></p><p><p>Richard Francis is a biographer, historian of American culture, and novelist. He was an American Studies Research Fellow at Harvard, and taught American literature at the universities of Missouri and Manchester. He is nowProfessor of Creative Writing at Bath Spa University in England.</p>In this lively chronicle, historian Francis (<i>Transcendental Utopias</i>) offers a compelling portrait of the decline of Puritan ways in the late 17th century and the ascent of a secular spirit in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Although devout, Samuel Sewall (1652&#x2013;1730) turned away from an early religious vocation to pursue a career in public office and married into the colony's aristocracy. He found himself catapulted into the limelight as one of nine judges who condemned the alleged witches of Salem in 1692. Francis calls this the turning point in Sewall's life and work. Never convinced that the condemned women were guilty, Sewall felt remorse; in 1697 he walked into a Boston church and offered a public apology, the only one of the three judges to do so. As a result, he was rebuffed by his social circle. Yet, according to Francis, Sewall's courage is magnified by his taking a stand he knew would result in ostracism. In his later years, Sewall wrote tracts opposing the colonists' treatment of Indians and slaves. Francis beautifully captures not only Sewall's personality and significance but also the shifting times in which he lived, when it was becoming no longer possible to "see the world as a simple allegorical struggle between... good and evil."

Behind that groundbreaking thought experiment was his hope that we would be inspired to find a way to add humans back to this vision of a restored, healthy planet-only in harmony, not mortal combat, with the rest of nature.<br><br>But with a million more of us every 4 1/2 days on a planet that's not getting any bigger, and with our exhaust overheating the atmosphere and altering the chemistry of the oceans, prospects for a sustainable human future seem ever more in doubt. For this long awaited follow-up book, Weisman traveled to more than 20 countries to ask what experts agreed were probably the most important questions on Earth--and also the hardest: How many humans can the planet hold without capsizing? How robust must the Earth's ecosystem be to assure our continued existence? Can we know which other species are essential to our survival? And, how might we actually arrive at a stable, optimum population, and design an economy to allow genuine prosperity without endless growth?<br><br>Weisman visits an extraordinary range of the world's cultures, religions, nationalities, tribes, and political systems to learn what in their beliefs, histories, liturgies, or current circumstances might suggest that sometimes it's in their own best interest to limit their growth. The result is a landmark work of reporting: devastating, urgent, and, ultimately, deeply hopeful.<br><br>By vividly detailing the burgeoning effects of our cumulative presence, <em>Countdown</em> reveals what may be the fastest, most acceptable, practical, and affordable way of returning our planet and our presence on it to balance. Weisman again shows that he is one of the most provocative journalists at work today, with a book whose message is so compelling that it will change how we see our lives and our destiny.</p><p>Alan Weisman is the author of several books, including <i>The World Without Us</i>: an international best-seller translated in 34 languages, a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award, and winner of the Wenjin Book Prize of the National Library of China. His work has been selected for many anthologies, including <i>Best American Science Writing</i>. An award-winning journalist, his reports have appeared in <i>Harper's</i>, <i>The New York Times Magazine</i>, <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>, <i>Discover</i>, <i>Vanity Fair</i>, <i>Wilson Quarterly</i>, <i>Mother Jones</i>, and <i>Orion</i>, and on NPR. A former contributing editor to the <i>Los Angeles Times Magazine</i>, he is a senior radio producer for Homelands Productions. He lives in western Massachusetts.<br>"Spirited descriptions, a firm grasp of complex material, and a bomb defuser's steady precision make for a riveting read... Weisman's cogent and forthright global inquiry, a major work, delineates how education, women's equality, and family planning can curb poverty, thirst, hunger, and environmental destruction. Rigorous and provoking, <i>Countdown </i>will generate numerous media appearances for Weisman and spur many a debate."<i> </i>-- <i>Booklist </i>(starred review)<strong></strong><br><br>"Provocative and sobering, this vividly reported book raises profound concerns about our future." -- <i>Publishers Weekly</i> (starred review)<br><br>"Weisman offers heart-rending portrayals of nations already suffering demographic collapse... A realistic, vividly detailed exploration of the greatest problem facing our species." -- <em>Kirkus </em>(starred review)<br><br>"Rousing." -- Ihsan Taylor, <i>New York Times Book Review</i>'s "Paperback Row"<br><br>"Unflinching and ready for anything, Weisman's <i>Countdown</i> tackles the biggest question facing not only us, but every other living thing on earth. How many people can there be on the earth? Written with extraordinary clarity, without all the arm-waving and doomsaying that seems to kill the conversation, his firsthand tour of the globe offers both worst case scenarios and the most hopeful futures we can imagine." -- Craig Childs, author of <em>Apocalyptic Planet </em>and <em>House of Rain</em><br><br>"<em>Countdown </em>converts globetrotting research into flowing journalism, highlighting a simple truth: there are, quite plainly, too many of us. A world that understands Weisman's words will understand the pressing need for change." -- Bill Streever, author of <i>Cold</i> and <i>Heat</i><br><br>"A frenzied barnstormer of a book.... <i>Countdown</i> is a chaotic stew of big stories, bold ideas and conflicted characters, punctuated by moments of quiet grace--just like our people-packed planet." -- <i>Scientific American</i><br><br>"A hugely impressive piece of reportage, a cacophony of voices from across the world." -- <em>Washington Post</em><br><br>"Rousing, urgent.... By exploring and integrating the lessons from cultures the world over, Weisman has been able to provide a blueprint that will ultimately benefit the planet as a whole. "Countdown" is a timely, essential, and hopeful work - one that suggests compassion in place of consumption and promises a return to an equilibrium that will prove a veritable windfall for humans, non-humans, and ecosystems alike." -- <em>The Oregonian</em><br><br>"<i>Countdown</i><b> </b>is a gripping narrative by a fair-minded investigative journalist who interviewed dozens of scientists and experts in various fields in 21 countries. He also scoured the literature to deliver not so much a doomsday narrative but a warning followed by the practical solution employed by various countries to get control of their population." -- <i>Wall Street Journal </i></p><h2>The Other End of Time (Eschaton Sequence)</h2><p>Sent to investigate alien signals warning of the destruction of Earth by the malevolent Horch, a group of astronomers led by Dan Dannerman is taken prisoner by aliens with their own diabolical plans for Earth, but these aliens have underestimated the ingenuity of their human captives.</p><p>A distinguished veteran of science fiction, Frederik Pohl, was one of the Futurians, a New York City club of the 1930s and 40s that included Isaac Asimov.

Even at the time, writes Briggs, many thought the inquisitions against witchcraft absurd, but still thousands died, mostly women, mostly poor. Examining contemporary accounts and court records -- 300 of them from the duchy of Lorraine alone -- Briggs notes that the inquisition heightened divisions between the educated and the uneducated classes, &#34;as their world views polarized to the point where vast areas of what had once been common belief were stigmatized as superstition.&#34;Robin Briggs is a senior research fellow of All Souls College and a university lecturer in modern history at Oxford.</p><h2>Dreaming the Divine: Techniques for Sacred Sleep</h2><p><i>Dreaming the Divine </i>by Scott Cunningham (previously published as S<i>acred Sleep: Dreams &amp; the Divine) </i>is one of the most unique books ever published on dreams. Most authorities agree that dreams are very important for those on a spiritual path. This book shows you how to push beyond the boundaries of ordinary dreaming, and introduces you to the concept of making sleep a spiritual act. <br> <br>This process is known as "dream incubation" or "sacred sleep." The technique was practiced in dream temples around the ancient world, including those in Egypt, Babylon, Greece, and Rome. Dream incubation is the process of creating sacred dreams for a specific purpose: healing, advice, glimpses of the future, protection, conception of children, battle plans, and a host of other reasons. Now you can learn this technique in <i>Dreaming the Divine. <br> <br></i>Tucked inside this book, you'll find practical and simple techniques for receiving sacred messages in your dreams, including: <br>- How to prepare for sacred sleep <br>- Dream rituals and spells to achieve your sacred sleep goals <br>- The meanings of dream symbols seen during sacred sleep <br>- Dream messengers and deities from numerous cultures <br>- Natural sleep-inducing techniques including prayer, special baths, special foods to eat and others to avoid, herb teas, scented pillows, aromatherapy, and several others <br>- How to remember and record your sacred sleep dreams. <br> <br>Seeking communion with the divine through dreams is one of the oldest forms of personal spirituality. Sacred sleep is one way to remove spirituality from the hands of the "experts" and place it where it belongs: in the hearts, minds, and dreams of everyday people. Get <i>Dreaming the Divine </i>and make your dreamtime special. <br></p><p>Scott Cunningham practiced magic actively for over twenty years.

Essayists Cruz, Jones and Smith offer insights into Sherman&#39;s art from several vantage points, positioning it within the trajectory of feminist art history and revealing her influence since the 1970s.</p><p><b>Amanda Cruz</b> is the Manilow Curator of Exhibitions at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago. <b>Elizabeth A. T. Smith</b> is Curator at The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. <b>Amelia Jones</b> is an associate professor of contemporary art and theory and the history of photography at the University of California, Riverside.Cindy Sherman has taken self-portraiture and masquerade to the highest heights and the campiest lows, bringing the shady ambience of B-movies to art photography while exploring the plexus of narcissism, from its silliest manifestations to its most provocative expressions. Sherman explores the implications of role-playing and fantasy, seeing and being seen, and society's perceptions of women, eroticism, and consumerism in her photographs, creating resonant images and supplying art critics with much grist for their mills. In her contribution to this retrospective volume, Amelia Jones begins with the remark that "much ink has been spilled over Cindy Sherman," and, obviously, the flow continues, but Jones, Cruz, and their colleagues provide just the sort of commentary Sherman's work demands, and the photographs themselves are engaging, both viscerally and intellectually. Sherman has been in costume before her own camera for more than 20 years, earning the right to a major traveling exhibition and speculation as to what she'll come up with next.

First deployed in Vietnam in 1967 and loaded with a formidable arsenal of weaponry, the Cobra was the first helicopter designed from inception as an attack aircraft. It dramatically changed the nature of the war in Vietnam by offering the Army, for the first time, its own powerful and highly accurate weapons platform for close-air-support missions. <br><br>Randy Zahn arrived in Vietnam shortly before the 1970 U.S. invasion of Cambodia, one of the most impressive demonstrations by the Cobra in the war. He describes his stunning transformation from a naive, middle-class teenager from southern California to a hardened killer during his tour in Vietnam. Unlike the pilots who flew the fast-moving strike jets, Zahn experienced the war &#x201c;up close and personal,&#x201d; witnessing the grisly effects of the Cobra&#x2019;s firepower on enemy soldiers. The author does not glorify killing but rather explains in sharp relief the kaleidoscope of emotions associated with combat: fear, revenge, hate, remorse, pity, and even ecstasy. He captures many of the ironies and nuances inherent in Vietnam, especially during the final years of the conflict. Zahn displays a sensitivity rarely found in memoirs written by battle-hardened warriors. This human element, combined with the vast amount of archival research and interviews with members of his former unit, ensures that <i>Snake Pilot</i> will become the definitive account of the role helicopters played in Vietnam.</p><p>Randy R. Zahn is the chief pilot, Alaska Rotor Wing Division, for Era Helicopters in Anchorage, Alaska. He learned to fly helicopters while serving in the U.S. Army from 1968-71. He served a tour of duty in Vietnam (1970-71), earning two Distinguished Flying Crosses, a Bronze Star, two Air Medals for valor, and two Army Commendation Medals for valor. He lives in Eagle River, Alaska.&#34;[Zahn] writes with authority . . . he captures the intensity of moments long since buried in the memories of those who lived them. . . . He has produced a book that is not so much a memoir of events past as a freshly discovered live report from the past. . . . It has lessons to teach the &#39;battle captains&#39; of today. . . . The glimpse it offers of leaders-as-seen-by-the-led should be of value to anyone who leads the smart, aggressive, competent, self-asured young Mr. Zauns of today.&#34; --ARMY</p><h2>Tomb of Pharoah Seti I</h2><p>Used.

Katherine Frank, whose biography of Mary Kingsley won wide critical acclaim, brings a novelist&#x2019;s dramatic flair and a brilliant gift for analysis to this bold reinterpretation of Emily Bront�&#x2019;s life: the negligence of her sickly father, her affliction with anorexia, the fierce need to rebel that produced <i>Wuthering Heights</i> and her magnificent poetry.<br> &nbsp;<br> Probing the depths of Emily Bront�&#x2019;s dark nature as no other biographer has done, Frank also sheds new light on her special place in her gifted, doomed family and her consuming relationships with Charlotte and her alcoholic brother, Branwell. <i>A Chainless Soul</i> paints an intimate, vivid, and deeply affecting portrait of one of the greatest, and most misunderstood, artists of nineteenth-century fiction.</p><p>Born and educated in America, <b>Katherine Frank</b> is the author of several acclaimed biographies, including those of Lucie Duff Gordon, Emily Bronte, Mary Kingsley, and Indira Gandhi. She lives in England.The author of a biography of Mary Kingsley ( A Voyager Out , LJ 9/15/86), Frank justifies her addition to the massive stacks of Bronte literature by claiming to demonstrate that Emily suffered from anorexia nervosa as a response to feelings of helplessness and a need for control. However, she seldom quotes reliable sources for substantiation and even contradicts herself on occasion, as when she states that we know nothing of Bronte's tenure as a governess at Law Hill, then asserts that the homesick young woman fasted herself into illness there in order to return to Haworth. It's impossible to tell whether Bronte's behavior conformed to a clinical definition of anorexia, since Frank fails to provide such a definition. She offers instead a rambling rehash of previously published Bronte family biographies with too much imaginative speculation about what Emily and others were feeling based on too little solid evidence.<br><i>- Judy Mimken, Cardinal Stritch Coll., Milwaukee</i><br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Tarot</h2><p>A compendium of information on the Tarot including its origin, myths and facts about the Tarot.

Thanks to the unique immediacy with which photography captures perspective and history, the popularity and use of the camera spread rapidly around the globe. Today, photography is ubiquitous: from newspapers and fashion magazines to billboards and the film industry, cultures worldwide have embraced this malleable artistic medium for a limitless variety of purposes. <p> </p><p>Naomi Rosenblum's classic text investigates all aspects of photography--aesthetic, documentary, commercial, and technical--while placing photos in their historical context. Included among the more than 800 photographs by men and women are both little-known and celebrated masterpieces, arranged in stimulating juxtapositions that illuminate their visual power. Authoritative and unbiased, Rosenblum's chronicle of photography both chronologically and thematically traces the evolution of this still-young art form. Exploring the diverse roles that photography has played in the communication of ideas, Rosenblum devotes special attention to topics such as portraiture, documentation, advertising, and photojournalism, and to the camera as a means of personal artistic expression. The revised fourth edition includes updates on technical advances as well as a new chapter on contemporary photographers.

Beevor is braver, rightly exposing the open approval of a number of Allied generals for a policy of retaliatory execution of German prisoners. This is history as it should be written. . .

Earth's precious flint is vital to their technology; when a British hacker creates a disturbance by using ``one of those old machines'' to create a football team of real historical personages, the Reigners are drawn, one by one, to the scene. There, greengrocer's daughter Ann Stavely has become involved with the extraordinary characters appearing in the wood: Mordion, with skull-like features but a beatific smile, has emerged from a long entrapment; Hume--who springs from the earth where Mordion's blood mingles with Ann's after a minor injury--is a different age each time she meets him. Entering the present-day wood, the Reigners are absorbed into Arthurian Britain, where each persona (including dragons and a number of robots and machines) has several intricately linked identities- -past, present, extraterrestrial, mythological. For those who enjoy the intellectual exercise of sorting them out, and of pondering whether God is in the machine or Christ is an ironic parallel to the Reigners' Servant (who bears the guilt of crimes he's forced to commit), the game offered here is unsurpassed; meanwhile, the grappling of the heroes-in-disguise with the avaricious (and chillingly human) Reigners and the emergence of their kindlier potential successors makes an elaborate, fascinating, and suberbly crafted adventure.

But <i>The Japanese Experience: Inevitable</i> reveals far more than the successful cloning of morphed <i>manga</i> motifs onto stretched canvas and museum walls. It represents eight positions in contemporary Japanese art and scrutinizes their complex visual vocabulary, noting references to Japanese and Western art traditions as frequently as the borrowing of mass culture motifs from the realms of <i>manga</i> and <i>anime</i>. Takashi Murakami's <i>MR. DOB</i> questions the place of contemporary art in our global society; Aya Takano's glowing watercolors combine Japanese sensitivity, issues of female identity, and sci-fi; Masahiko Kuwahara's mutant animals provide shades of softness and mysterious openness, and Yoshitomo Nara's reworking of historical Japanese woodcuts disturbs the floating world. Not only are the artists' visual repertoires new and surprising, but their creative methods and strategies help conquer a public that is mostly untouched by contemporary art.

These early exploits introduce all of the memorable characters who remained in the strip for the rest of the decade: the one-armed General Bruno, the Baroness Erica Von Kampf (with a swastika branded on her forehead), Albino Jo, and the all-American Gary Hale and Detective Carey, who each vies for Marla's affections. The stories range from downright kinky to all-out action against Nazis, spies, cuthroats, and thieves. Edited by Trina Robbins and designed by Lorraine Turner.<br><br>Eisner Award-nominee for BEST ARCHIVAL COLLECTION!</p><p>June Tarpe Mills (1915-1988) had been a fashion model and illustrator and contributed minor strips such as<i>The Purple Zombie</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Daredevil Barry Finn</i>&nbsp;to comic books for two years when the much more successful&nbsp;<i>Miss Fury</i>&nbsp;made its debut in national newspapers in 1941, beating&nbsp;<i>Wonder Woman</i>to the punch by eight months. From the beginning, Mills signed her comics with her sexually ambiguous middle name because, as she said in a newspaper interview, &#x201c;It would have been a major let-down to the kids if they found out that the author of such virile and awesome characters was a gal.&#x201d;Although she did beat Wonder Woman into print by several months, Miss Fury isn&#x2019;t the first female superhero; several obscure distaff costumed crime fighters preceded her, and she&#x2019;s not technically a superhero, since she lacks extrahuman powers. What&#x2019;s more important is that her creator, Mills, was a pioneering female cartoonist and one of the few women who drew an adventure strip. Her creation was wealthy socialite Marla Drake, who donned a form-fitting black leopard-skin suit to become the mysterious adventuress Miss Fury. These first three years of the strip&#x2019;s 1941&#x2013;52 run are mostly set in an exotic South American locale, where Marla&#x2014;who spends more time in street clothes than her cat suit&#x2014;is involved in wartime espionage with sinister Nazis. Mills&#x2019; art was merely serviceable and the stories contrived and dialogue-heavy, but the strip, and this attractive collection, are of historical interest not only for the gender of its artist but as a rare example of a long-running costumed hero from newspaper strips rather than comic books. --Gordon Flagg</p><h2>The Ominous Omnibus (A Series of Unfortunate Events, Books 1-3)</h2><p><p>Within the pages of this omnibus, readers will discover all three books upon which the movie Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events is based: <strong>The Bad Beginning</strong>, <strong>The Reptile Room</strong>, and <strong>The Wide Window</strong>.

An adjunct professor at Yale University and former editor in chief of <i>The Yale Law Journal</i>, she was also a clerk for the U.S. Supreme Court under Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and served as counsel to Federal Communications Commission chairman Reed Hundt. The book's references are highbrow, too, with Rubin quoting and alluding to everyone from Machiavelli and Sun Tzu to Plutarch, Shakespeare, and Edith Wharton.<p> That said, the book is still rather, well, silly, albeit more fun and dishy than the average book on getting ahead. It's sort of what you'd expect if <i>People</i> magazine or <i>US Weekly</i> were to put out career guides. Here we learn all sorts of traits that mark the powerful (Ronald Reagan reinstated much of the pomp of the presidency after it was clear the public hadn't gone for President Carter's "common man" approach); the rich (Christina Onassis had her 10-seater airplane fly between France and New York once a week to ship her 100 bottles of Diet Coke, which wasn't available in France); the very famous (Madonna's bodyguards forbad the staff of a hotel where she was staying to speak her name, talk to, or so much as directly look at her); and the sexy (Marilyn Monroe was reputed to have cut a quarter-inch off the heel of one shoe to achieve her legendary "wiggling" walk). </p><p> Unfortunately, the book is more effective in relating these anecdotes--what people have done once they've achieved power, wealth, fame, or sexiness (which, of course, involves varying amounts of the prior three characteristics, depending on whom one is trying to attract), or what we, humble readers, might do ourselves once we arrive--than it is in telling us how to get there ourselves. It's a bit like a title it even mentions once, the early 1980s hit <i>The Official Preppy Handbook</i>. That little item also purported to be a how-to, but its delineation of a clearly inbred, elitist lifestyle was meant to be laughed at as much as it was to be taken seriously. Not that you won't learn anything here--far from it: <i>Power Money Fame Sex</i> is astute on every page. It's simply that the thing appears designed to entertain more than to actually edify poor slobs like the rest of us. --<i>Timothy Murphy</i></p><b>Gretchen Craft Rubin</b> received her undergraduate and law degrees from Yale and was editor in chief of the <i>Yale Law Journal.</i> She clerked on the United States Supreme Court for Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and served as counsel to Federal Communications Commission Chairman Reed Hundt.

But only in Germany did racist stereotypes evolve into a popular ideology of such lethal force that it ended in the horror of the death camps. Despite a vast literature about anti-Semitism and the Holocaust, we do not yet understand why the destruction of the Jews was conceived and implemented by the Germans. Ideology of Death supplies this understanding in a stunning and disturbing narrative history. Exploring the unique nature of the German experience as well as the annals of anti-Semitism, Mr. Weiss rejects the notion that the Holocaust was a product of Nazi fanaticism. He shows instead how racist ideas ingrained in German culture led to the unthinkable. Tracing the culture of racism and anti-Semitism among powerful elites and ordinary Germans, Mr. Weiss shows how it grew rapidly during the Napoleonic era, became a forceful popular ideology in the 1870s, and in the 1890s gained the dedicated support of the generation that eventually brought Hitler to power. &#34;German Jews became the victims of a uniquely powerful culture of racism&#34;, he writes. &#34;Without this historical base, anti-Semitism would not have exploded with such fury after 1918, producing hundreds of thousands of followers whose ideas were no different from those of the Nazis&#34;. Drawing on the latest research, Mr. Weiss describes how the Nazis, building on traditional German anti-Semitism, adjusted their appeal to a wide variety of social groups that were crucial to their electoral success. The Nazis&#39; extraordinary popularity &#34;could not have occurred if Hitler&#39;s hatreds were unique&#34;, theauthor points out. Nor could the actions against the Jews, leading to their destruction. Most Germans saw nothing wrong with such actions. Mr. Weiss explains the specific complicities of various German groups and institutions in the Holocaust, and why they voluntarily cooperated with the Nazis.John Weiss's <i>Ideology of Death: Why the Holocaust Happened in Germany</i> was lauded for its balanced interpretation.

Heroes are often defined as ordinary characters who find themselves facing extraordinary circumstances and, through courage and a dash of luck, cement their place in history. Chosen as President Roosevelt&#39;s fourth term Vice President for his admired work ethic, good judgement and lack of enemies, Harry S. Truman was the prototypical ordinary man from small-town America. That is, until he was thrust in over his head following the sudden death of Roosevelt. With the world still caught up in the inferno of the Second World War, Truman found himself playing the roles of both judge and jury during the founding of the UN, the Potsdam Conference, the Manhattan Project, the German surrender, the liberation of the Nazi concentration camps and the decision to drop the Bomb and bring the war to the end. Tightly focused, meticulously researched and drawing on documentation not available to previous biographers, The Accidental President escorts readers into the situation room with Truman during this tumultuous, history-making four months - when the stakes were high and the challenges even higher . . .</p><p></p><h2>Spray Finishing</h2><p><p>This guide explains the process of spray finishing which gives a professional looking finish to woodwork. It explains how to choose and set up a spray finishing system, discusses materials for spraying and how to handle them, and includes coverage of water-based finishes and HVLP systems.</p></p><p>A professional-looking finish is the dream of most woodworkers. One way to achieve it is through modern spray finishing. Spray finishing is a lot less trouble than it used to be - recent technological breakthroughs have made a previously messy and expensive process safer, easier and cheaper. The development of water-based finishes and HVLP spray systems has put spray finishing within the grasp of any small-shop woodworker willing to learn the technique and make a modest investment in equipment. Andy Charron, a professional woodworker, has been experimenting with spray finishes for some years and has experience with a number of systems. He has put this expertise into a comprehensive volume that explains the entire process. Charron describes how each system works and how to choose the system that&#39;s right for the kind of work you do - from guns and spray booths to compressors, turbines, air lines, filters and safety equipment. You&#39;ll also learn how to work with lacquers, crosslinked finishes, shellac, polyurethane and water-based finishes; how to color, stain and tone the wood; how to spray contact cement; and how to clean your equipment when you&#39;re done. A troubleshooting chart at the end of the book will help you identify and solve problems at a glance.<p>Andy Charron is the contributor for Taunton Press titles including <em>Water-Based Finishes.</em></p></p><h2>The Food of Spain (A Journey for Food Lovers) (Murdoch Books UK Limited)</h2><p>Food of Spain gives a person a real taste of this country&#39;s intense passion for food, wine and the time-honored culinary traditions that make Spain unique.</p><p></p><h2>Lefty&#39;s Favorite Fly-Fishing Waters</h2><p>For almost forty years, Lefty has been fishing all over the States.

Then six words appeared to her: "in the morning there was hope." These became the first words of her autobiography, <i>Early Spring</i>, fitting for a book that spares the reader none of the squalid details of Tove Ditlevsen's first eighteen years, yet is filled with beauty and aspirations. Tove Ditlevsen grew up in a Danish working-class neighborhood, the child of constantly arguing and often impoverished parents. There was no physical privacy, and yet her way of thinking and love of words kept her apart from her harsh and domineering mother, her father who loved her yet told her that "girls can't be poets," and her friends who were mostly interested in sex and stealing. While the details of her life can be harsh, Tove Ditlevsen portrays her neighborhood and family with well-considered love: "Down in the bottom of my childhood my father stands laughing. He's big and black and old like the stove, but there is nothing about him that I'm afraid of." Telling her story primarily through the consciousness of herself as a child and then as an adolescent, Tove Ditlevsen recreates the naive, touching egotism of her youth. <i>-- For great reviews of books for girls, check out Let's Hear It for the Girls: 375 Great Books for Readers 2-14</i>. -- <i>From 500 Great Books by Women; review by Erica Bauermeister</i></p><h2>Seasonal Velocities</h2><p><i>Seasonal Velocities</i> invites the reader on a fragile and furious journey along the highways and skyways of discovery, retribution, and resolve.

She is a professor of English at Santa Monica College.In the hands of Ryka Aoki, words can be everything - a tool, a fire, a gift, a weapon, a meal, a barricade, a refuge. I was tempted to ration this book, so I'd have some when I needed it, but found myself gulping it down and was so nourished by it the whole way along. --S. Bear Bergman, <i>The Nearest Exit May be Behind You</i>, and <i>Gender Outlaws: The Next Generation</i>.<br><br><i>Seasonal Velocities</i> is a startling gem of a book. With her characteristic honesty and a powerful, fierce grace, Ryka Aoki carries us through fear in the dark, the half-lives of scars, home, and hope. As vivid and unflinching as they are lyrical, these words deliver and demand sparkling truth even as they speak of violence, longing and love. Rather than aiming to transcend, Aoki invites us to make alliance with all the contradictions of being human, to grow stories, to listen, and to build community despite everything. --A. Finn Enke, Director of LGBT Studies, University of Wisconsin, Madison<br><br> <i>Seasonal Velocities</i> is what I want my son to hold of the trans community, the poetry of raw and reunion that I wish for his heart. Earnest, unflinching, exquisite, centered and sharp in its own uncertainty this book is his community legacy that I am proud to pass down. For my son's heart, for mine, for all of our winters, thank you, thank you, thank you for it. --TT Jax, Editor, Lambda Literary</p><h2>Man Eaters: True Tales of Animals Stalking, Mauling, Killing, and Eating Human Prey</h2><p>Attacks by bears, cougars, sharks, alligators, snakes, lions, tigers, and more<br></p><p>The reports and eyewitness accounts present here span many years and varied global settings, ranging from the desolate to breath-taking Edens where the beauty of the land belies the atmosphere of tragedy. Some of the stories are legendary - "The Man-Eaters of Tsavo," for instance. Some, like the grizzly attacks in national parks, were once newspaper headlines. Others are obscure events of individual heroism and ordeal, no less gripping for their obscurity.The rewards of the outdoor life touch something deep and satisfying inside many of us. The wild country that can sustain bears and other magnificent creatures looms in our thoughts constantly, pulling us beyond pavement's end. We follow the trails taken by countless kindred spirits, including naturalists such as John Muir, who urged, "Climb the mountains and get their good tidings. Nature's peace will flow into you as sunshine flows into trees."While pursuing such wilderness experiences, we must respect the fact that other creatures share the same ground. A priority for us all must be the sensibilities and woodsmanship by which we can avoid the types of ugly and unfortunate incidents that are recounted in these pages.

I saw a BBC special on it once&#x2014;I thought they said Ruby Kallie, but now I know they were saying the Rub al-Khali&#x2014;the &#x201c;quarter of emptiness.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s the sea of sand that makes up a fifth of the Arabian Peninsula, but for us it could mean Death Valley, or the Gila wilderness, or the Spanish Pyrenees, and once, it was an island in the Bay of Siam that we had to sail a small boat to.&nbsp;But it had to be empty&#x2014;it had to be without people. That was the only safe place where I could do it, where I could practice.&nbsp;&#x201c;We just can&#x2019;t chance it, Griff. You want to do this, this is the only way.&#x201d;&nbsp;We were living in the United States then, five thousand miles from England, in San Diego, in a garage flat at the north end of Balboa Park, but when Dad said that, we were a hundred miles east of the flat. We&#x2019;d taken the Yuma cutoff, U.S. 98 off of Interstate 8, and it was hot and windy and sand was blowing across the road.&nbsp;I was only nine then, used to not knowing anything, always asking, always pushing. &#x201c;Then why do it at all&#x2014;why should we even take this chance?&#x201d;&nbsp;He looked sideways at me and sighed, then back to the road, swerving slightly to avoid a bouncing tumbleweed the size of a Volkswagen. &#x201c;It comes down to . . . could you do that? Could you walk away from it? I mean, for me, it would be like spending the rest of my life in a wheelchair, even though I could still walk. I&#x2019;d be pretending I could do naught, you know, making myself do everything the hard way when by just standing up and taking a few steps I could reach that stuff off the wheelchair ramp, the stuff on the upper shelf.&#x201d;&nbsp;He sped up a little as we reached a rocky stretch where there wasn&#x2019;t quite so much blowing sand. &#x201c;And, dammit, it&#x2019;s a gift! Why the hell shouldn&#x2019;t you be able to do it? Just because they&#x2014;&#x201d; He clamped his mouth shut and looked back at the road.&nbsp;For once I didn&#x2019;t push it. There were some things my parents just wouldn&#x2019;t talk about, and what happened back in Oxford was one of them. When I&#x2019;d first jumped, at five, from the steps of the Martyr&#x2019;s Memorial in front of a busload of tourists. Well, not then, exactly, but after, the thing that caused us to leave the UK and keep moving.&nbsp;Dad began watching the odometer closely, checking the map. He hadn&#x2019;t been there before&#x2014;our Empty Quarters were always different. He drove past the road, only recognizing the turn after we passed because a tangle of tumbleweeds hid the cattle guard that marked it. We were the only ones on the highway&#x2014;he just backed up and made the turn, switching the Range Rover into four-wheel as soon as he was in the loose sand on the other side of the grate.&nbsp;&#x201c;Tell me the rules,&#x201d; he said.&nbsp;&#x201c;Go on, Dad!&#x201d; I knew the rules. I&#x2019;d known them since I was six.&nbsp;&#x201c;So, back to the flat? It&#x2019;s two hours, but I&#x2019;ll do it.&#x201d;&nbsp;I held up my hand. &#x201c;All right, all right!&#x201d; I held up four fingers and ticked them off one by one. &#x201c;Never jump where someone can see me. Never jump near home. Never jump to or from the same place twice. And never, never, ever jump unless I must&#x2014;or unless you or Mum tell me to.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;And what does that mean&#x2014;that you must?&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;If I&#x2019;m going to get hurt or captured.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;Killed or captured by who?&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;Anyone.&#x201d; Them. That&#x2019;s all I knew. The strangers from Oxford.&nbsp;&#x201c;And what does it mean if you break the rules?&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;Have to move. Again.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;Yeah. Again.&#x201d;&nbsp;We drove for another forty-five minutes, though it was slow going. &#x201c;This&#x2019;ll have to do. Any farther and we&#x2019;ll be too close to the border. Don&#x2019;t want to attract the INS.&#x201d; He turned up a dry wash and went on until we couldn&#x2019;t see the road and the hills of the ravine rose up on both sides.&nbsp;It took us ten minutes to climb to the top of the higher ridge, so we could see all around. Dad used his binoculars, taking forever. Finally he said, &#x201c;Okay. In the ravine only, right-oh?&#x201d;&nbsp;I danced in place. &#x201c;Now?&#x201d;&nbsp;He said, &#x201c;Now.&#x201d;&nbsp;I looked down at the Rover, toy-sized, at the bottom of the ravine, and then I was there, sand settling around me as I fumbled with the gate.&nbsp;By the time Dad had hiked back down I&#x2019;d changed into the coveralls and the goggles and I had the face mask hanging loosely around my neck. When he came trudging across the sand and gravel, I was laying out the paintball gun and the hopper full of rounds and the CO2 cartridges.&nbsp;He took a drink from the water bottle and offered it to me. While I drank he put on his own goggles and loaded the gun.&nbsp;&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t wait for me to fire. This is pretty fast&#x2014;maybe two hundred feet per second&#x2014;but you could still jump before it arrived if you were far enough away. But bullets travel thousands of feet per second. You wait till they fire, and you&#x2019;ll be dead.&nbsp;&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t let anyone even point a weapon at you.&#x201d;&nbsp;I was just seating the face mask when he shot me, point-blank, in the thigh.&nbsp;&#x201c;Fuck!&#x201d; I yelled, grabbing my leg. The paint was red and I put one of my hands right in it.&nbsp;&#x201c;What did you say?&#x201d; Dad looked half mad, half amused. I could swear he was trying not to laugh.&nbsp;I blinked, looking down at the red paint on my hand. My leg hurt. It hurt a lot, but I wasn&#x2019;t supposed to use that word. I opened my mouth to reply but Dad said, &#x201c;Never mind,&#x201d; and lifted the gun again.&nbsp;Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice . . . &nbsp;The paintball splattered across the gravel, but I was twenty feet off to the side. Dad twisted and got off a quick shot but the reason it didn&#x2019;t hit me was that he missed, not that I&#x2019;d jumped in time. I felt the wind of the projectile go past my head but then I was on the far side of the truck and the second shot passed through empty air, before tumbling through the branches of a creosote bush.&nbsp;&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; he yelled. &#x201c;Hide-and-seek, unlimited.&#x201d;&nbsp;I turned around and began counting loudly. I heard his feet crunch across gravel and then nothing. The second I counted thirty, I jumped sideways, thirty feet, expecting to hear the poooof of the paintball gun, but Dad was nowhere in sight.&nbsp;There were several stretches of sand in the wash and one of these had a fresh set of widely spaced tracks leading across it. I jumped to the stretch of sand without crossing the gravel and followed them.&nbsp;I had to find him without getting shot. But I could jump as much as I wanted. Around a bend in the ravine, the tracks were closer together but they went another fifty feet and stopped in the middle of the wash. Stopped.&nbsp;Dad wasn&#x2019;t there, either, and there wasn&#x2019;t anything nearby he could have stepped onto. For just a second, I thought, Maybe . . . maybe Dad could&#x2014;&nbsp;The paintball caught me on the butt. It didn&#x2019;t hurt near as much as the last one but it hurt my pride. I spun and jumped at the same time, sideways, ten feet, sloppy&#x2014;there must&#x2019;ve been ten pounds of dirt falling away from me and jump rot hanging in the air where I&#x2019;d been. Twisting, fading jump rot.&nbsp;Dad was stepping out from behind some scrub. The gun hung loosely at his side.&nbsp;I pointed at the line of tracks in the sand. &#x201c;Did you jump?&#x201d;&nbsp;He laughed, almost a bark. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t I wish! I just turned around and walked back in my tracks.&#x201d; He pointed at some rocks near his hiding place. &#x201c;Stepped off the sand there and Bob&#x2019;s your uncle.&#x201d; He pointed his finger at the ground and twirled it like he was stirring a drink. &#x201c;Again.&#x201d;&nbsp;I turned around and started counting loudly. As he ran off he shouted over his shoulder, &#x201c;Look for more than tracks in the sand!&#x201d;&nbsp;And that&#x2019;s the sort of thing we did for the next hour. We did hide-and-seek, limited (where I couldn&#x2019;t jump until I saw him), and tag, where I had to jump close enough to touch him and get away without getting shot, and closed room, where we drew a big square in the sand and I could jump anywhere in it but not leave it, while he fired shot after shot.&nbsp;Once he hit a patch of jump rot where I&#x2019;d been and the paintball exploded, coming back out as high-velocity pieces of plastic film and a mist of spray paint. Another time, I jumped late and the paintball came with me, tumbling through the brush at right angles to its original path, but missing me.&nbsp;Dad was perplexed. &#x201c;Wow, I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ve ever seen it do that before.&#x201d; Dad had this theory that the jump rot was like, well, like the wake of a ship, the disruption of the water when a vessel passes through. It&#x2019;s like the turbulence or maybe even a hole I leave behind.&nbsp;When I jump in a hurry, sloppily, there&#x2019;s more of it and I carry more crap with me. When I&#x2019;m focused, if there is jump rot, it&#x2019;s tiny, and fades away almost instantly.&nbsp;We continued. When Dad said, &#x201c;Enough,&#x201d; I had one more paint mark on my right shoulder blade, but he&#x2019;d gone through seventy paintball rounds. He let me shoot a dozen rounds at a boulder, enough to finish off the last of the CO2 cartridge, and then we went home.&nbsp;He never said anything about my swearing and I never said anything about him shooting me in the leg.&nbsp;Call it even.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tuesday and Thursday afternoons I had karate class.&nbsp;Mum had a doctorate in French literature but she didn&#x2019;t work. She was homeschooling me. She said that I just got too bored in the public education system, but I heard them talking once, when they thought I was asleep.&nbsp;Dad said, &#x201c;What can we do about it? He&#x2019;s too young to hold a secret this big all the time. It&#x2019;s not fair to him and it&#x2019;s too dangerous. Maybe later, when he&#x2019;s older.&#x201d;&nbsp;Mum said, &#x201c;He&#x2019;s not a kid. No kid ever talked like that&#x2014;he&#x2019;s a miniature adult. He needs to run up against kid logic and skin his knees where we&#x2019;re not there to pick him up. He needs to make friends.&#x201d;&nbsp;The compromise was karate class. The homeschooling curriculum required a physical education equivalent so I had to do something.&nbsp;I think Dad went for it because of the discipline and because he thought, from the class he watched, that the kids never talked to each other. Well, we weren&#x2019;t supposed to talk during class but it was an after-school program at the elementary school two blocks away&#x2014;all form-one kids. Of course there was talking.&nbsp;I liked our instructor, Sensei Torres. He didn&#x2019;t play favorites and he was very gentle and he was very careful to keep Paully MacLand in check.&nbsp;Paully was in fifth grade for the second time and he was almost as tall as Sensei Torres. He&#x2019;d been doing the karate program since first grade and had a green belt.&nbsp;And he was mean.&nbsp;We were doing two-step kumite partner practice. One person would attack with a punch and the other would block and counterpunch. I was working with Paully and he wasn&#x2019;t interested in the exercise. He was interested in hurting.&nbsp;There was a definite no-contact rule. If you kicked or punched you had to stop short of hitting anybody. It was a firm rule and anyone who broke it had to sit out and could get dropped from the class if he kept doing it. Paully knew that. One of the kids told me Paully was kicked out of the class back in fourth grade for repeated offenses and was only allowed back the next year.&nbsp;What Paully did instead was turn his blocks into strikes. He&#x2019;d block so hard, it hurt&#x2014;it left bruises. Like, perhaps, a paintball round in the thigh, point-blank.&nbsp;I didn&#x2019;t swear this time, though. I gritted my teeth instead and kept going. To hit so hard, Paully was drawing back, cocking before the block, which required he start almost before I actually punched. Next time it was my turn, I broke my rhythm, stepping in, but delaying the punch slightly. He blocked and missed my arm entirely. My punch stopped just short of his nose.&nbsp;Sensei Torres laughed and had everybody change partners. Later he said to me privately, &#x201c;Good eyes, Griff. It was bad karate. In a real fight, you can&#x2019;t block a strike that hasn&#x2019;t even started.&#x201d;&nbsp;But Paully was waiting when I finished changing for the walk home, just inside the locker room, blocking the door. &#x201c;So, you limey ass-licker, think you&#x2019;re somethin&#x2019; with that stutter punch? Think you can make me look bad in front of Sensei?&#x201d;&nbsp;Maybe Dad was right about me having trouble keeping my mouth shut. It just came out, unbidden.&nbsp;&#x201c;Bollocks. You don&#x2019;t need me to look bad. You do that all by yourself.&#x201d; Right away I was sorry I said it, scared, in fact, but how do you take something like that back, especially when you mean it?&nbsp;He just charged, rage painted on his face like red paint, his fist cocked back and looking larger than any paintball.&nbsp;I couldn&#x2019;t help it. Really, I didn&#x2019;t mean to do it, I didn&#x2019;t mean to break the rule, but one second his fist was heading toward my face like a thrown rock and the next I was standing in a cloud of dust in a ravine, next to a paintball-splattered boulder, out in the Empty Quarter.&nbsp;I&#x2019;d just broken rules number one and two (don&#x2019;t jump near home and don&#x2019;t jump where someone can see me) and maybe even rule four (don&#x2019;t jump unless I must&#x2014;if I&#x2019;m going to get killed or captured).&nbsp;I was in so much trouble.&nbsp;Copyright � 2007 by Steven C.

And yet, little is known about this weeklong clash of more than two thousand Soviet and German tanks in a stretch of northwestern Ukraine that came to be known as the &#x201c;bloody triangle.&#x201d; </p><p> </p><p>This book offers the first in-depth account of this critical battle, which began on 24 June 1941, just two days into Operation Barbarossa, Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union. Author Victor Kamenir describes the forces arrayed against each other across that eighteen-hundred-square-mile-triangle in northwestern Ukraine. Providing detailed orders of battle for both Wehrmacht and Red Army Forces and contrasting the strengths and weaknesses of the Soviet and German tanks, he shows how the Germans slowly and decisively overwhelmed the Russians, apparently opening the way to Moscow and the ultimate defeat of the Soviet Union. And yet, as Kamenir&#x2019;s account makes clear, even at this early stage of the Russo-German war the Soviets were able to slow down and even halt the Nazi juggernaut. Finally, the handful of days gained by the Red Army did prove to have been decisive when the Wehrmacht attack stalled at the gates of Moscow in the dead of winter, foreshadowing the end for the Germans.</p></p><p><p>THE BLOODY TRIANGLE<br> The Defeat of Soviet Armor in the Ukraine, June 1941</p><p>The armored clash near the Russian city of Kursk in 1943 has been widely known as the largest tank battle in history, involving over six thousand armored combat vehicles on both sides. However, the first large-scale armored struggle on the Eastern Front took place immediately following the German invasion of the Soviet Union.<br> In the early days of Operation Barbarossa, eighteen German divisions from Sixth Army and Panzer Group 1 were directly involved in the battle of the Bloody Triangle, which featured massive tank formations on both sides of the frontlines. From June 24 to July 1, roughly 650 German tanks and 180 assault gun and tank destroyers fought over 1,500 Soviet tanks in a roughly triangular area of approximately 1,800 square miles between the northwestern Ukrainian towns of Lutsk, Dubno, and Brody.<br> The Bloody Triangle details this titanic clash, which is one of the most important but little-known battles of World War II. This book gives an account of the epic battle, from the early planning when German intelligence determined the Soviet command and support structures to be slow to respond, bulky, cumbersome, and not ready to adapt to the rapidly changing tactical situation, to the last convulsive counteroffensive by the Russians on July 2, 1941. It is largely told in the words of the men who were there and sheds new light on how Soviet tank units melted away under merciless German hammer blows in 1941.</p>That the greatest tank battle of World War II occurred near Kursk in 1943 is well known among enthusiasts and historians of the war. The second greatest tank battle of the war, however, was the Battle of the Bloody Triangle, the first large-scale armored struggle on the Eastern Front. The battle was fought in a triangle-shaped area encompassing 1,800 square miles in northwestern Ukraine and involved over two thousand tanks. The result mirrored that at Kursk, with one side decisively defeating the other. In this case the Germans defeated the Russians.<br> The road to Moscow now seemed wide open and the defeat of the Soviet Union inevitable. However, the Red Army had been able to slow down the Nazi juggernaut for a critical week at the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, ultimately giving the Soviets the time they needed to muster their considerable resources and stop the German blitzkrieg at the gates of Moscow in the dead of winter, which proved to be the high-water mark of Hitler&#x2019;s thousand-year Reich.<br> Author Victor Kamenar includes full order of battle information for both Wehrmacht and Red Army Forces along with a thorough analysis comparing and contrasting the strengths and weaknesses of the Soviet and German tanks.</p><h2>Amelia Earhart: The Mystery Solved</h2><p>A re-creation of Amelia Earhart&#39;s final flight draws on a recently rediscovered report and lost radio logs of her last transmissions to explain what really happened when Earhart&#39;s plane vanished during her around-the-world flight</p><p><b>Elgen M. Long</b> is the only person to have flown solo around the world over both poles. His career includes 40,000 hours of worldwide flying in everything from 1930s Boeing 314 seaplanes to Boeing 747s. During World War II, Navy patrol flights in the Pacific often took him over Howland Island, Earhart's destination on her final flight.<p> <b>Chapter One: Tragedy Near Howland Island</b> </p><p> Friday morning, July 2, 1937, Lae, New Guinea. It was not yet ten o'clock, but the tropical sun already beat down unmercifully on the twin-engine Lockheed Electra. Inside the closed cockpit, Amelia Earhart and her navigator, Fred Noonan, could feel the heat build as they taxied away from the Guinea Airways hangar. </p><p> The heavily loaded plane lumbered slowly across the grassy airfield toward the far northwest corner. Soon they would take off southeastward toward the shoreline, to take advantage of a light breeze blowing off the water. When they reached the jungle growth at the end of the field, Earhart swung the plane around to line up with the runway for departure. Only 3,000 feet long, the grass runway ended abruptly where a bluff dropped off to meet the shark-infested waters of the Huon Gulf. </p><p> Earhart was preparing to take off with the heaviest load of fuel she had ever carried. She and Noonan had flown 20,000 miles in the previous six weeks. Now only 7,000 miles of Pacific Ocean separated them from their starting point in California. The Electra, nearly 50 percent overloaded, was weighted to capacity with 1,100 gallons of fuel for the 18-hour flight to the next stop, Howland Island. Less than a mile wide, two miles long, and twenty feet high, their destination was just a speck of land that lay nearly isolated in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. It was truly a pioneering flight over a route never flown before, and they would be the first to land at the tiny island's new airfield. Two more firsts for the famous thirty-nine-year-old aviator, who upon reaching California would become the first woman pilot to have flown around the world. </p><p> Fred Noonan, at age forty-four, was famous in his own right. As chief navigator for Pan American Airways he had navigated the Pan American Clippers on all their survey flights across the Pacific. Now, both he and his pilot knew that the grossly overloaded takeoff would put their lives at great risk. </p><p> Fred watched closely as Amelia ran up each engine and checked it for proper operation. She gave the instruments a final scan, and they were ready to go. The moment of truth had arrived. </p><p> Amelia advanced the engine throttles full forward and released the brakes. The roaring, straining airplane slowly accelerated as it began its ponderous takeoff roll. Her feet were busy on the rudder pedals, moving them left, right, back, and forward to keep the plane going straight down the runway. They passed the smoke bomb that marked the halfway point to the shoreline. The tail wheel was already off the ground; they were going over 60 mph. There was no stopping the heavy plane now; it was fly or die, and the bluff at the end of the runway was coming up fast. Amelia applied back pressure on the control wheel to lift off the ground. The force required was lighter than she expected, and the plane over-rotated slightly as the wheels left the runway. She relaxed some of the pressure, allowing the nose-high attitude to decrease slightly. </p><p> They were off the ground, but their airspeed was too slow for optimum climb. When they were beyond the edge of the bluff, Amelia let the plane sink slowly until it was only five or six feet above the water. She signaled Fred to retract the landing gear, and the electric motor began cranking the wheels up into the nacelles to reduce drag. The seven seconds required to retract the landing gear seemed more like seven minutes as the engines struggled at full power to increase the airspeed. </p><p> After several seconds, Amelia could tell that she needed less back pressure on the control wheel to hold the craft level. This signaled that the battle between the engines and the drag of the airplane was slowly being won by the engines. The airspeed was increasing; they were going to make it. When the indicated airspeed increased to optimum climb speed, Amelia let the plane rise from its dangerous position just over the water. After they were safely a couple hundred feet in the air, she gently turned the plane to a compass heading of 073 degrees, direct for Howland Island. She reduced the engines to climb power and quickly scanned the engine gauges to check that everything was normal. They breathed easier as the plane slowly rose to the recommended initial cruising altitude of 4,000 feet. </p><p> Fred wrote down their takeoff time from Lae as 0000 Greenwich civil time (GCT), July 2, 1937. Having calculated that the flight to Howland Island would take 18 hours, they had to time their arrival to occur at daylight the following morning. Fred would need the stars to be visible for celestial navigation until just before they reached the island. </p><p> Amelia had arranged for a message to be sent from Lae to notify the Coast Guard cutter <i>Itasca</i> at Howland Island of her departure. The 250-foot Lake class cutter was waiting just off the island to provide communications, radio direction-finding, weather observations, and ground servicing for her flight. The captain of the <i>Itasca</i> was to notify all other stations, including the U.S. Navy auxiliary tug <i>Ontario.</i> The <i>Ontario</i> was positioned approximately halfway between Lae and Howland Island, in order to provide weather reports and transmit radio homing signals for Earhart. </p><p> Harry Balfour, the Guinea Airways radio operator at Lae, was receiving new wind forecasts for Earhart's flight just as she was taking off. The messages indicated that the headwinds to Howland Island would be much stronger than reported earlier, when they had expected only a 15 mph headwind. Fred had subtracted this headwind from the 157 mph optimum true airspeed to calculate a 142 mph ground speed. At 142 mph it would take them 18 hours to fly the 2,556 statute miles to Howland Island. </p><p> Earhart's radio schedule with Lae called for her to transmit her messages at 18 minutes past each hour, and to listen for Lae to transmit its messages at 20 minutes after the hour. Balfour attempted to report the stronger headwinds to Earhart by radio at 10:20, 11:20, and 12:20 local time, but she never acknowledged having heard him. In addition, for more than 4 hours after she departed from Lae, local interference prevented signals sent by the plane from being intelligible until 0418 GCT. </p><p> At 0418 GCT (2:18 p.m. local time), Balfour finally received a radio transmission from Earhart using the daytime frequency of 6210 kilocycles. She reported: "HEIGHT 7,000 FEET SPEED 140 KNOTS" and some remark concerning "LAE" then "EVERYTHING OKAY." </p><p> At four hours and eighteen minutes into the flight they were already experiencing stronger headwinds than anticipated. The increased winds had made them recalculate their optimum speed. Amelia reported the change to 140 knots (161 mph) in her message. </p><p> Maintaining the correct airspeed was important, but Earhart also had to fly at the correct altitude for optimum fuel efficiency. As the engines burned fuel, the plane's weight would decrease and the optimum altitude would increase. At any given aircraft weight there is a specific altitude for best fuel economy. The higher temperatures common in the tropics reduce the density of the air. Above the optimum altitude the temperature's effect on air density is equivalent to approximately a 2,000-foot increase in altitude and a corresponding increase in fuel consumption. The Electra would lose fuel efficiency below the optimum altitude but not nearly as rapidly as when flying above it. For maximum efficiency in the tropics, the Electra had to be flown approximately 2,000 feet below the recommended pressure altitude. </p><p> Balfour heard the next report from Earhart in Lae one hour and one minute later, at 0519 GCT. She reported: "HEIGHT 10,000 FEET -- POSITION 150.7 EAST, 7.3 SOUTH -- CUMULUS CLOUDS -- EVERYTHING OKAY." </p><p> Perhaps the cumulus clouds or the 9,000-foot mountains of Bougainville Island had forced them to the very</p></p><h2>Ambushed!

The colony on Roanoke Island off of the coast of North Carolina-115 men, women, and children-had disappeared without a trace. For four hundred years, the question of what became of the doomed settlers has remained unanswered. Where did they go? What really happened? Why were they on Roanoke Island in the first place, as that was not their destination? Using her consummate skills as an anthropologist and ethnohistorian, <b>Lee Miller</b> casts new light on the previously inexplicable puzzle of Roanoke, unraveling a thrilling web of deceit that can be traced back to the inner circle of Queen Elizabeth's government to finally solve the lasting mystery of the Lost Colony.</p><p>"What Lee Miller offers here is an exciting and original look at a great historical mystery, and her conclusions are as convincing as her research is thorough. The intellectual breadth and literary elegance of this book are perhaps matched only by the novel solution that her sensitivity to her subject and her anthropological acumen allow her to venture. <b>Roanoke</b> is deeply compelling, so much so that it is surely destined to claim a permanent place in the American colonial record." <br>--A. David Napier <br> Professor of Anthropology <br> Middlebury College <p>"<b>Roanoke</b> is ethnohistory at its best, written in a vivid style and bursting with new insights. Miller is not afraid to ask questions historians should have asked but haven't. Using anthropological tools, she brings the Lost Colony to life and, at the same time, has created an absorbing and thrilling read, full of fascinating details most historians omit. This will be a benchmark study, uniquely deserving of serious scholarly attention.

She is also the author of more than one hundred romance titles and a series of romantic suspense novels, the Edwardian Mystery series. Born in Scotland, she now divides her time between Paris and the English Cotswolds.Chesney ( Animating Maria ) turns out another frothy Regency romance, whose compulsory figures include Lord Charles Marsham, exquisite from his impeccably tied cravat to his gleaming Hessian boots, who is perfectly contented with his bachelor life of guzzling and gambling, and prim, proper Harriet Brown, Methodist minister's daughter come to London's social season to find a husband. But Capability Brown, as Charles calls her, is so intent on involving him in her "good works," which range from rescuing treed felines to playing Cupid for the outspoken Tribble sisters--themselves matchmakers for misfits on the marriage mart, with Harriet their latest challenge--that her own romance seems to be an afterthought. Chesney, in the fifth and final installment of her School for Manners series, overburdens a short book with copious subplots and offers a paucity of erotic chemistry. There are too many charming characters, too many nefarious villains, all after Harriet's reputation and person, even too many casually committed murders--and thus too many roads for readers to travel before arriving at the expected "happily ever after." <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>How Johnny Popper Replaced the Horse: A History of John Deere Two-Cylinder Tractors</h2><p>Book by Donald S.

This causes come confusion, as everyone thinks Martha Jane is the proprietor. The action in the tale springs from the hospitalization of the unnamed owner, and the neighborhood's competition to care for Martha Jane. Finally the pooch chooses a man who often brings her a bone. "The woman and the big man liked each other so much that they got married. Martha Jane went on the honeymoon, of course." Martha Jane is the star of this tale, and the humans around her, including the interracial newlyweds, are cardboard. Rylant's full-color illustrations are deep-hued and childlike, with vivid decorated borders surrounding each spread. Their effect is primitive and pleasing. The language, however, is void of Rylant's typical sense of play or poetry. The message, that adults can come together through the love of a dog, lacks insight. Martha Jane is a stolid protagonist, but pales in the shadow of Martha in Susan Meddaugh's Martha Speaks (Houghton, 1992). In the end, this tale is simply a paean to a puppy.

The sleety rain, which had put a stop to weapons practice outside, hurled against the shutters like glass needles. Every torch and sconce was ablaze, every brazier in use. Beyond their puddles of light and warmth, in the stairwells and dark walkways of Westminster's sprawl of buildings, a dank chill waited to envelop anyone foolish enough to step outside without a cloak.</p> <p>Seated in a window embrasure of the White Hall, Fulke listened to the growl of the wind and buffed his new shield to smooth the scores and scratches sustained that morning. His father had given it to him at Martinmas when Fulke had turned fifteen, a man's accoutrement quartered in the FitzWarin colors of indented red and white.</p> <p>"Hah, sixes, I win!" cried a triumphant voice.</p> <p>Raising his head from the shield Fulke glanced over at the dice game which was occupying Prince John and the other squires of Ranulf de Glanville's retinue. Money chinked as a curly-haired squire swept a pile of coins from the trestle into the palm of his hand. Prince John, who was almost eighteen, scowled and reached into the pouch at his belt to toss more silver onto the board.</p> <p>Fulke might have joined them except he had no more than a silver halfpenny to his name. Had the sport been arm wrestling he would have taken part. Unlike Madame Fortune, skill and brawn were dependable and he possessed an abundance of both.</p> <p>The other lads had called him bumpkin and clod when he arrived from the Welsh Marches nine months ago. They had stolen his clothes, tripped him on the stairs, and emptied a piss-pot over him while he slept. It had taken them a week to learn the hard way that whatever Fulke received was returned twofold. They still called him bumpkin, but these days it was a nickname, a sign of acceptance into their company, if not their rank.</p> <p>That he had a position in John's retinue was by way of a favor to his father from King Henry who valued the loyalty of the FitzWarin family. Fulke knew that John would never have chosen him for a companion, and the feeling was mutual.</p> <p>Fulke looked again at the dice players. John caught his eye and glowered. "In Christ's name, stop making love to that accursed shield and bring some more wine." He waved his empty cup at Fulke. An amethyst ring flashed on his middle finger.</p> <p>"Sir." Fulke laid his shield carefully aside, fetched the flagon from the sideboard, and approached the game.</p> <p>"Fancy your chances, Bumpkin?" asked the curly-haired squire.</p> <p>Fulke smiled, his flint-hazel eyes brightening. "I fancy yours more, Girard." He nodded at the new pile of coins on the trestle. "I'll arm wrestle you for them if you like." Having poured the wine into John's cup, he left the flagon for the others to help themselves.</p> <p>Girard snorted. "I'm not falling for that one again!"</p> <p>Fulke's smile broadened into a grin and he flexed his forearm where rapidly developing muscle tightened the sleeve. "That's a pity."</p> <p>Girard made a rude gesture and scooped up the dice. Fulke stayed to watch him throw a total of three and lose his winnings, then sauntered back to the window embrasure and his shield. Two padded benches sat either side of the latched shutters and between them was a gaming table on which John's tutor, Master Glanville, had placed a heavy wooden chessboard.</p> <p>Leaning on his shield, Fulke contemplated the ivory pieces with a feeling of nostalgia bordering on homesickness. He imagined his family's manor at Lambourn: the faces of his brothers etched in firelight as they played knucklebones by the hearth; his mother sewing by the light of a sconce; he and his father playing chess in an embrasure just like this one, his father's brow puckering as he considered his next move. Fulke knew he was gilding the image for his present comfort but, there was still an underlying truth and solidity to the picture. While not wretchedly homesick, he missed the warmth and companionship of his family. He often thought it a pity that his father's next move had been to send him here to learn the skills of knighthood among the highest in the land.</p> <p>"It is a great honor that King Henry has done our family," Fulke le Brun had said to him last spring having returned from attendance at court. "Not only will you be tutored by Ranulf Glanville the Justiciar, but he will mingle with men of influence who may be able to help us." Fulke could remember the flush to his father's sallow complexion, the spark of ambition in the deep brown eyes. "Whittington could be ours again."</p> <p>"What's Whittington?" Fulke's youngest brother Alain had piped up. He was only four years old and unlike the older boys had yet to have the FitzWarin cause c�l�bre drummed into him blood and bone.</p> <p>"It's a castle and lands belonging to us," said their mother, gathering Alain into her arms. "Your papa's family held it in the days of the first King Henry, but then it was taken away from them during a war and never restored. Your papa has been trying to get it back for a long time." It was a tale told in simple terms that a small child could understand, and her voice was level, omitting the antagonism and bitterness that had built and festered over the years of striving.</p> <p>"Too long," said Fulke le Brun. "Roger de Powys claims Whittington as his, but he has no right."</p> <p>"If King Henry loves you enough to make me Prince John's attendant, why doesn't he give you Whittington?" Fulke had wanted to know.</p> <p>"It is not as simple as the King's word," his father had said. "Our right has to be proven in a court of law and sometimes if a matter is awkward or seen as a mere quibble, it is pushed aside for more pressing concerns. God knows I have tried. The King has made promises, but it is not as important a matter to him as it is to me." He had looked intensely at Fulke and gripped his shoulder, man to man. "Ranulf de Glanville is well positioned to hear our plea, and he will be your tutor. Do your best for him, and he will do his best for you."</p> <p>And Fulke had done his best because it was not within his nature to shirk and he had as much pride as his father. His ability to fathom accounts had increased beyond all measure beneath the Justiciar's instruction and he had picked up the broader points of Latin and law. What Master Glanville made of him, however, he did not know for his tutor was a solemn man in late middle age, not much given to open praise.</p> <p>Fulke pushed his hair off his forehead and grimaced. He was not sure that being educated at court was a grand privilege at all. Being at Prince John's beck and call was a nightmare. At home, Fulke was the heir to his father's lands, cherished, sure of his status, lording it affectionately over his five brothers. Here he was of minor rank, a nobody to be used as John saw fit.</p> <p>There was a sudden flurry at the dice table as Prince John shot to his feet sending the flagon that Fulke had so recently replenished crashing to the floor. "You thieving sons of whores, get out, all of you!" John gestured wildly at the door. "You're all leeches. There's not one of you worth a pot of piss!"</p> <p>Fulke slid out of his corner and started to follow the other squires from the chamber.</p> <p>"Not you, Bumpkin," John snarled. "Get me some more wine."</p> <p>"Sir." Expression blank, Fulke stooped to the flagon in the rushes near John's feet. An ugly dent married its silver-gilt belly.</p> <p>"You shouldn't have left it on the table," John said petulantly. "It's all your fault and you can pay for a new one."</p> <p>It would have been wiser to keep quiet but Fulke refused to bow to tyranny. "That is unjust, sir."</p> <p>John eyed him through narrowed lids. "Are you arguing with me?"</p> <p>Fulke stood up, the damaged flagon in his hand. "It is true that I left the flagon here when I should have replaced it on the sideboard, but I did not knock it off the table."</p> <p>John jabbed a warning forefinger. "You'll pay and that's an end to it. Now fetch more wine and make haste."</p> <p>Scarcely bothering to bow, Fulke strode from the room. Despite the winter chill, he was scalding with fury. "I won't pay him a single fourthing," he muttered as he flung into the hall beyond the chamber and marched down its length to the butler's table at the far end.</p> <p>"For Prince John," he said woodenly to the attendant.</p> <p>The butler eyed the damage with pursed disapproval. "How did this happen?"</p> <p>"An accident." Even though Fulke wanted to throttle John, honor and discretion fettered his tongue in front of others.</p> <p>"That's the third &#x2018;accident' this month then." The butler set the flagon beneath a wine tun and turned the spigot. "These flagons don't grow on trees, you know. Cost half a mark each, they do."</p> <p>Close on seven shillings, Fulke thought grimly: a week's wages for a mounted sergeant and beyond his own reach unless he appealed to his father or spent an entire week arm wrestling for the funds.</p> <p>Although John had bid him make haste, Fulke lingered over his return to the royal apartment, giving his anger time to cool. He was partially successful. By the time he banged on the door and entered with the flagon, his resentment had banked to a smolder.</p> <p>John had unlatched the shutters by the chessboard and was leaning against the window splay, gazing into the stormy dusk. Darts of wind-driven sleet hurled past the embrasure. The courtyards and alleys were in darkness-no torch would remain lit in this weather-but there were glimmers and flickers of light from the occupied halls, and the watchmen had built a brazier in a sheltered corner of the ward. Further away, the windows of the great abbey glittered like dark jewels.</p> <p>John turned, one fist curled around his belt, the other resting on the shutter. "You took your time."</p> <p>"There were others waiting the butler's service, sir," Fulke lied and poured wine into John's cup. "Do you want me to leave now?" He tried to keep the hopeful note from his voice but k...</p></p><h2>The Hundred Thousand Fools of God: Musical Travels in Central Asia (and Queens, New York)</h2><p><p>""This erudite, absorbing volume chronicles the travels of ethnomusicologist Theodore Levin through urban and rural Transoxania...

There are several reasons, but the most important are that bass are more fun to catch and are more widely distributed than trout and other coldwater fish. Bass get a bad rap; they are not witless, gullible gluttons, but actually become selective feeders faster than trout. Bass have also been shown to have higher IQs than trout, so your imitations must closely match the naturals on which they feed. Bass flies have undergone a major evolution in refinement and are now on par with the quality and design of the flies tied for coldwater species, like trout and salmon. Renowned fly tier and innovator Skip Morris guides you through the unique world of bass flies, including basic techniques &amp; tools; bass-fly materials &amp; hooks; flaring &amp; shaping hair; tying snag guards, eyes, tails, &amp; legs. Fly types include: Floating, Sinking, Divers, Insects &amp; Crayfish, and Panfish. So give the trout and salmon a break, go catch some feisty bass on a large, noisy, and active.</p><p></p><h2>Reboot with Joe: Fully Charged - 7 Keys to Losing Weight, Staying Healthy and Thriving: Juice on with the creator of Fat, Sick &amp; Nearly Dead</h2><p>Reboot with Joe Fully Charged - 7 Keys to Losing Weight St</p><p></p><h2>How the Leopard Changed Its Spots: The Evolution of Complexity</h2><p>Applying the laws of physics to the study of life and the growth of complex forms, the author proposes a powerful source for the origin of species and offers an alternative to modern Darwinism and twentieth-century genetics.</p><p><p>"This is a brilliant book, wonderfully written. . . .

Traveling with his Cambridge tutor John Ray, they decided to overhaul the whole of natural history by imposing order on its messiness and complexity. It was exhilarating, exacting, and exhausting work. Yet before their first book, <i>Ornithology</i>, could be completed, Willughby died in 1672. Since then, Ray's reputation has grown, obscuring that of his collaborator. Now, for the first time, Willughby's story and genius are given the attention they deserve.</p><p>In his too-short life, Francis Willughby helped found the Royal Society, differentiated birds through identification of their distinguishing features, and asked questions that were, in some cases, centuries ahead of their time. His discoveries and his approach to his work continue to be relevant--and revelatory--oday. Tim Birkhead describes and celebrates how Willughby's endeavors set a standard for the way birds--and indeed the whole of natural history--should be studied. Rich with glorious detail, <i>The Wonderful Mr Willughby </i>is at once a fascinating insight into a thrilling period of scientific history and an authoritative, lively biography of one of its legendary pioneers.</p></p><p><b>Tim Birkhead</b> is a professor at the University of Sheffield where he teaches animal behavior and the history of science.

He lives in Brighton, England, with his wife, Julie, and his two children, Joseph and Anna.PreSchool-Grade 2-Every year just before winter arrives, Hedgehog settles down for a long nap. Wondering what that season is really like, he enlists Rabbit to save "a little bit" of it for him. Rabbit agrees to help but is forgetful. Midwinter, Rabbit comes across a message inscribed on the bark of a tree reminding him of the request and comes up with an ingenious way to preserve a piece of winter for his appreciative friend. Children will laugh at the animals as they toss zippy dialogue back and forth as real friends do. Riddell alternates full-color and white backgrounds and full-page and spot illustrations effectively. The facial expressions and comic mannerisms of the creatures will allow youngsters plenty of opportunities to surmise how the story is progressing while the endpapers and illustrations echo the seasonal changes beginning in the throes of winter and ending in the lushness of spring.<br><i>Lisa Gangemi Krapp, formerly at Sousa Elementary School, Port Washington, NY</i><br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The complete food preservation book: How to can, freeze, preserve, pickle, and cure edibles</h2><p>Book by Barbour, Beverly</p><p></p><h2>The Hardtack Regiment: An Illustrated History of the 154th Regiment New York State Infantry Volunteers</h2><p>&#34;The Hardtack Regiment traces the progress of the 154th New York Infantry Volunteers from the regiment&#39;s organization in 1862 in Cattaraugus and Chautauqua counties to the mustering out in 1865.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Mark Mothersbaugh: Collected Facts &amp; Lies</h2><p>This collection of fifty postcards is pulled from the archives of legendary artist and musician Mark Mothersbaugh, cofounder of the New Wave band Devo.

Gloriana&#39;s reign brings the Empire of Albion into a Golden Age, but her oppressive responsibilities choke her, prohibiting any form of sexual satisfaction, no matter what fetish she tries. Her problem is in fact symbolic of the hypocrisy of her entire court. While her life is meant to mirror that of her nation - an image of purity, virtue, enlightenment and prosperity - the truth is that her peaceful empire is kept secure by her wicked chancellor Monfallcon and his corrupt network of spies and murderers, the most sinister of whom is Captain Quire, who is commissioned to seduce Gloriana and thus bring down Albion and the entire empire.</p><p>SALES POINTS * Part of the Fantasy Masterworks series * &#39;A great read...fiction writing at its best; a craftsman in full possession of his powers as Moorcock is here is a joy&#39; Maxim Jakubowski, Vector * &#39;He is a giant.

It bothers his parents and his sister. After a while the blinking stops, but then Nathan starts sniffing. A doctor explains that Nathan&#39;s movements are called tics.</p><p>Niner is an Albert Whitman author.Kindergarten-Grade 4&#x2013;At first, Nathan can't stop winking. When it ceases, he repeatedly sniffs. Head snapping replaces the sniffing. The child's repetitive behaviors upset his family and his friend Josh; they also distract his classmates. Although Nathan's age is not stated, Treatner's realistic artwork in a painterly style suggests that he is in an intermediate grade. When he becomes tearful and distraught over his inability to stop what he is doing, his parents finally take him to a doctor. Diagnosed with Tourette syndrome, Nathan learns to control new repetitive behaviors, called tics, without medication. Niner's informative but didactic story includes factual details about this compulsive disorder. An introduction for parents and teachers gives more information about it and notes that tics are common among children. The plot and primarily one-dimensional characters are devices to educate readers about TS. There is lots of dialogue, and the students in Nathan's class represent diverse cultures. Very few books are available for young audiences on this medical concern; what's out there tends to be nonfiction for older readers. Thus, this title does fill a void.<i>&#x2013;Lynn K.

The practice of the Pilates Method offered Gary support in his process of healing<br><br>from a serious illness. Healing is an inside job. Most of us are not given an owner's manual: We bungle toward balance and health. We rush. We eat and drink too much, too little. We work more and play less. We live outside of our natural selves; holding up; putting off, or just getting through until we can "feel or x" it later, until we can turn a corner and discover<br><br>the truth--health is the natural state of the body. Balance is within our grasp. That's the gift of this book: a contemporary voice of who, what, and how we nd that balance. The Pilates Path to Health emerged from the concepts of the foundational work of Joseph Pilates' Contrology. Gary, a contemporary voice in the Pilates community, recognizes Pilates as more than just an exercise regimen. He sees Pilates as a healthy lifestyle. Because Pilates is<br><br>evolving in a global community where people are seeking balance in all categories of their lives, this book is timely, acting as a marker of how Pilates is adapting and serving a 21st century world.<br><br>Book Award: The 2012 Readers' Choice Award for Best-in-Pilates book!"<br><br></p><p>Gary Calderone is one of the original graduates from The Pilates Center in Boulder, Colorado, studying under Rachel Segal, Amy Alpers, Steve Giordano, and Romana Kryzanowska (disciple of Joseph Pilates). Gary apprenticed for 18 months with Wendy LeBlanc-Arbuckle, creator of the Core Connections Pilates 3-dimensional Body Mapping Paradigm, and Program Director of the Core Connections at The Pilates Center of Austin (PCA). Both Boulder and Austin Teacher Training Programs are considered among the most rigorous and comprehensive in the country. As the founding director of the Pilates Center of Fort Collins, Colorado, Gary brought the classical teaching to the attention of the medical community, working and collaboration with MDs, NDs, PTs, D.C.s, CMTs, NMTs, Rolfers and acupuncturists illuminated the healing potential of the work - particularly around chronic and acute patient populations. In addition to his transformational training at The Pilates Center of Austin (PCA), Gary completed an Associate Directorship (2000-2002) of the Core Connections Pilates Training Program and was certified as a Teacher of Teachers for PCA. He has delivered PCA s Teacher Training Program to world class athletes in Austin and Chicago, and continues to travel nationally as a teacher of teachers for PCA.I appreciate what Gary is doing for the Pilates community putting together Joseph Pilates vision in a cohesive and enlightened manner what we intuit as teachers and as spiritual beings in order for us to understand Pilates intentions better.

Pilates is transformative. --Rachel Taylor Segel With Amy Taylor Alpers Co-founder and Co-owner The Pilates Center Boulder, Colorado<br><br>Anyone who has had the opportunity to read this work will find themselves eagerly awaiting their next Pilates session. I myself feel more 'anchored into my bones, the earth, and my life' just having read the manuscript. --Zoe Stein Pierce, Director, Pilates at Dancescape Studio, The Premier Pilates Studio of Fort Worth,TX<br><br>There are many books on the market that describe the Pilates method in detail and precision. However, Pilates is not just another workout fad. Joseph Pilates' message is a profound commitment to the life well lived. Health is a balance of the body, mind and spirit. These are the essential elements for happiness and success. Gary Calderone has applied his study and life to the embodiment of the Pilates philosophy, reminding the reader that Pilates is more than an exercise regimen, it is a path of study and enlightenment. --Pat Guyton, PMA Certified Pilates Teacher, Pat Guyton Pilates, Inc. Pilates Conservatory<br><br>Gary asks the right questions, inviting us to think outside the box about living a balanced life through the practice of Pilates. He masterfully unlocks the essence of Pilates' greatest secret - why and how Pilates profoundly impacts both student and teacher, weaving threads from other disciplines to confirm their universal connection. He illuminates the truth about how choices for our inner health are mirrored in the manifestation of our outer experience, thereby strengthening global consciousness. Truly inspiring! ----Clare Dunphy, Peak Pilates Master Trainer, Director Progressive Bodyworks, Inc.<br><br>This book is relevant and necessary for our future and our evolutionary process.

Gary s ability to present the material in a reader-friendly format with compelling evidence intertwined should be applauded. Our industry is consistently seeking new models for the delivery of integrated and results-focused initiatives that provide for the healthy lifestyles and outcomes of our clients. The Pilates approach to health truly focuses on awareness, choice and results. As an industry leader I believe this book will add value to the industry understanding of Pilates and its multifaceted benefits. Gary's writing illustrates his passion for why he and others practice and teach Pilates. The Pilates Path to Health provides evidence of the restorative health benefits for those who consciously choose the Pilates Method. --Jeb Gorham, Ph.D., Wellness Director - Central Manager Miramont Lifestyle Fitness, Former Director of Education Peak Pilates<br><br>An inspiring guide to optimal human vitality and balanced living. Gary Calderone expands the definition of "fitness" in his quest to understand the mission of Joseph Pilates and the profound results of his work. --Matthew Zumann, CPT, Structural Therapist -Jennifer Golden Zumann, CPT, Medicinal Herbalist<br><br>This book is a wonderful support for individuals on a path of understanding themselves through the practice of the Pilates Method. Gary's writing illuminates aspects of these practices that transform body, mind, and spirit. In an age when Pilates mainstream popularity and easy access cause the loss of these vitals elements, it is necessary for strong voices, like this voice, to be heard, so that the depth of the Pilates Method and what it can offer the practitioner are not lost. --Melissa Macourek, Samsara Pilates<br><br>Finally a book on the Pilates Method that is a not a "how to" but a "why". Gary's book speaks to our common love of the work and the amazing power of change that we all see everyday in our practice. This book takes me back to before the copyright days when the creative differences were celebrated and there was an amazing unified feeling of how special Joseph Pilates' method was and how blessed we were to be a part of that vision. We know how cool this work is and how great it feels. Gary does a good job of attempting to define this nature of the work. ----Nan Feist, LMP, Pilates Instructor, Somatic Educator<br><br>With the explosive growth of Pilates, we are in danger of losing the soul of Joseph Pilates vision.

I wish to express my gratitude to Nancy Malone, O.S.U., the tireless and visionary former editor of <i>Cross Currents: The Journal of the Association for Religion and Intellectual Life.</i> Along with her discerning coeditors, Joseph Cunneen and William Birmingham, Nancy introduced this story to the journal&#x2019;s interfaith readership by featuring my essay, &#x201c;In Each Other&#x2019;s Likeness,&#x201d; in its Spring 1995 issue (Vol. 45, No. 1). I have quoted briefly here from both that essay and my later piece, &#x201c;Exile and Memory: Reflections on Tisha B&#x2019;Av,&#x201d; which appeared in the Winter 1995&#x2013;96 issue of <i>Cross Currents</i> (Vol. 45, No. 4).</p><p>My friend J�rgen Manemann, of Westf�lische Wilhelms University, M�nster, Germany, further advanced the telling of the story by translating &#x201c;In Each Other&#x2019;s Likeness&#x201d; into German and facilitating its publication in the Swiss Catholic periodical <i>Orientierung,</i> where it appeared in August 1997 (Volume 6, Number 15/16). Similarly, I wish to thank Professor Randolph L. Braham, preeminent scholar of the Hungarian Holocaust, who graciously recommended my essay to the distinguished Budapest Jewish quarterly, <i>M�lt �s J�v&#x151;</i> [<i>Past and Future</i>], where it appeared in its 1997/2 issue.</p><p>From the very inception of this book project, I have been especially grateful for the friendship of Beverly Coyle. Her support and goodwill have helped to open doors, and her timely advice has familiarized me with the publishing world. My agent, Helen Rees, believed in this story and convinced me of its viability as a book, and her endless enthusiasm helped find the book a home with Viking. My editor at Viking, Jane von Mehren, steadily and decisively stewarded this project through the entire editorial process, from the initial board meeting to the crafting and shaping of the book through its various stages. I was blessed throughout by her skill, sensitivity, and unflagging good judgment, as well as by her gracious support. Jane&#x2019;s assistant, Jessica Kipp, provided a literary ear and thorough professionalism well beyond her youthful years. Copy editor Carole McCurdy&#x2019;s meticulous attention to detail and style, as well as her profound sensitivity to the story, helped to make this a better book than it otherwise would have been.</p><p>Abundant thanks, as well, to Joan Leegant and Ronnie Friedland for their generous editorial counsel during the early stages, and to Don Gropman and Sandi Gelles-Cole for their seasoned advice and adept assistance on the book proposal. My good friend Jeff Baker brought a keen and sophisticated sensibility to his reading of a first, voluminous draft of the manuscript. Charlie Puccia unselfishly did everything from arranging my travel to Italy to translating my uncle&#x2019;s Italian letters.</p><p>I extend my appreciation to Professor John Clabeaux of St. John&#x2019;s Seminary, in Brighton, Massachusetts, and Father Tom Kane, S.J., of the Weston Jesuit School of Theology, in Cambridge, both of whom refined my understanding of Catholic ritual, liturgical practices, and Scriptural interpretation. I am responsible for whatever errors remain in the text.</p><p>I also wish to acknowledge the dear members of the Boston One Generation After writers&#x2019; group, in whose warm and supportive company I thought and wrote, read, and listened for more years than I have worked on this book. Special thanks also to Cynthia Ozick, whose incisive correspondence alternately blessed my efforts and impelled me to think deeply and clearly about the painful history between Catholics and Jews.</p><p>I am immensely grateful to Katharina Lamping for the many hours during which she shared stories and vignettes with me of her seventeen years of service to my uncle and his parish church. My brother, Peter, and sister, Ellen, were always in my thoughts, especially when I wrote of our early years together. Although people&#x2019;s recollections of the same events can often vary widely, my siblings naturally served me as touchstones for those times. Thanks, as well, to Bob Buday, our long-lost relative, who also helped get this book off the ground. The excitement and love of the many extended-family members and personal friends who have watched me bring this story to life over the years, often in relative isolation, have been a source of ongoing comfort.</p><p>Although my father and mother are noted in numerous other places for the contributions they made to informing the content of this book, there is insufficient room to adequately thank them. I was initially afraid that they would tire of the many hours they spent with me during the past several years being recorded on audio, video, and notepad. I can only hope that they have been as enlivened by our encounters as I have been. I can now more confidently say that I truly know my parents&#x2014;what they have lived and suffered and how their lives have influenced the person I have become. May what my father and mother learn about their son for his efforts at portraying them prove equally as precious to them.</p><p>Finally, my dear wife, Judy, prolific reader and no-nonsense critic, gave timely and insightful feedback and showed immense patience and forbearance as wife and mother throughout the years of this project. This book would not have been conceivable without her abiding and loving presence. Last but not least, our sons, Ben and Elias, must often have wondered what this complex story was all about and when it would actually be completed. Now that I can place the book into their hands, may the silences that pervaded our family&#x2019;s life during my own childhood begin to be dispelled in theirs. I dedicate this book to them.</p><p><b>AUTHOR&#x2019;S NOTE</b></p><p>I began work on this book a few weeks after the death of my uncle, Monsignor George Pogany, in July 1993. It is a sad irony that I could not begin to tell the story of my Jewish father and his Catholic twin brother until after they were separated by death. When my uncle came to the United States in 1956, he promised my father that he would not bring up religious differences with his brother&#x2019;s children. In the aftermath of the brothers&#x2019; nearly two-decades-long separation, however, they seemed to have little ability or willingness to discuss with each other the agonizing matters of grief, disappointment, and recrimination surrounding their mutual losses in the war and my formerly devout Catholic father&#x2019;s return to Judaism after the Holocaust. Consequently, there was much silence growing up in their midst, interrupted by sometimes tense conversations about themselves and their family. Their sister&#x2019;s only visit from Australia, in 1984, generated discussions among the three siblings that helped familiarize me with virtually all of the people in earlier generations of our family, as well as with some of the more poignant themes in their lives.</p><p>When my uncle died, my father broke the brothers&#x2019; vow of silence about religion and the war. In the process, he revealed a truly astounding memory for details, going back to the beginning of their lives. He shared facts, conversations, and impressions of the various characters, as well as hunches about their inner lives and motivations. We took two trips to Hungary together, which liberated his memory and immensely enhanced my understanding of my father&#x2019;s origins.</p><p>As work on the book proceeded, my mother became equally engrossed in the project. She had always told dramatic and heart-wrenching tales of suffering, loss, and survival. Now, she provided necessary and gripping details, and courageously touched on closely guarded, painful stories of how her identity as a Jew had been threatened. These accounts only affirmed for me the resilience of the Jewish spirit, even after the Holocaust, and heightened my appreciation for my mother having so thoroughly instilled in her children a love of belonging to the Jewish people.</p><p>Partly through my uncle&#x2019;s lifelong love and solicitude toward me as his nephew, I gained a realistic and direct sense of him as a person. After his death, Katharina Lamping, George&#x2019;s devoted parish assistant and housekeeper of many years, provided invaluable insight into my uncle&#x2019;s faith and religious vocation. Katharina&#x2019;s reminiscences, coupled with the survival of a sizable collection of his homilies, as well as what my father eventually shared with me, helped me to form a picture of Father George&#x2019;s life as a singularly devoted Roman Catholic priest. Although the conversations I recount between him and Katharina occurred more in my imagination than in actuality, they are based on everything I have learned about the relationship between them, on actual events in George&#x2019;s life and statements he made, as well as on his psychological and spiritual sensibilities as evident in these sources.</p><p>In regard to my uncle&#x2019;s life with Padre Pio, in Rome I met with Padre Pio Abresch, George&#x2019;s former boyhood student of Greek (and chess) in San Giovanni Rotondo. Soon after, I journeyed to that town to visit the Our Lady of Grace friary, where I was graciously guided by Padre Joseph Pius Martin. Both of these very kind padres helped me gain a vivid appreciation of the years George spent in the service of the saintly Padre Pio of Pietrelcina.</p><p>In addition, the Reverend C. Bernard Ruffin was exceedingly helpful for his superlative biography of Padre Pio, which includes an invaluable interview with my uncle. The Reverend Mr. Ruffin&#x2019;s encouraging correspondence and phone conversation were also extremely informative. The most gentle and generous Father John A. Schug, Cap., who is also an eminent biographer of Padre Pio, shared with me the correspondence of Father Dominic Meyer, English and German secretary to Padre Pio from 1947 to 1959, relating to my uncle&#x2019;s life among the Capuchian fathers of Our Lady of Grace. Mrs. Anna Zegna of Biella, Italy, wife of the late Albino Zegna, was also helpful in this area. Both husband and wife had been close personal friends of my uncle and devoted followers of Padre Pio. Mrs. Zegna, along with her daughter and son-in-law, Gianna and Roberto Borsetti, provided valuable correspondence&#x2014;including many of my uncle&#x2019;s letters&#x2014;and precious insight into the nature of the lifesaving sanctuary Padre Pio offered my uncle as a Jewish-born Catholic priest in San Giovanni Rotondo during the years of the war. Ms. Maria Callandra, of the National Center for Padre Pio, in Barto, Pennsylvania, forthrightly shared her understanding of the inviolability of Padre Pio&#x2019;s spiritual purity in the midst of danger to innocent life during World War II. I wrestled greatly with her comments.</p><p>Events occurring among family members, as narrated here, are based on history that I witnessed or that was personally conveyed to me. They are honest attempts at capturing the spirit and content of interactions, many of which I know to have taken place but for which I could not have actually been present. They serve to establish a more vividly realistic and textured portrayal of social and historical circumstances.</p><p>I especially agonized over in...</p></p><h2>A New Orleans Voudou Priestess: The Legend and Reality of Marie Laveau</h2><p>Legendary for an unusual combination of spiritual power, beauty, charisma, showmanship, intimidation, and shrewd business sense, Marie Leveau also was known for her kindness and charity, nursing yellow fever victims and ministering to condemned prisoners, and her devotion to the Roman Catholic Church.&nbsp;In separating verifiable fact from semi-truths and complete fabrication, Carolyn Morrow Long explores the unique social, political, and legal setting in which the lives of Laveau&#x2019;s African and European ancestors became intertwined in nineteenth-century New Orleans.&nbsp;</p><p>"There are few figures in New Orleans history as alluring as Marie Laveau . . . a figure who stood at the very nexus of religion, magic, commerce, and history, and this fascinating, well-documented volume is the worthy result."--<i>New Orleans Times-Picayune</i>&nbsp;"In an era when most black Southern women were slaves, this savvy woman found not only freedom but tremendous power through her resourcefulness."--<i>Deep</i>&nbsp;"According to mysterious, oft-told-tales, Laveau was an extraordinary celebrity whose sorcery-fueled influence extended widely from slaves to upper class whites. . . .

She lives in San Francisco.<br><br>Mickey Hart is the former drummer for the Grateful Dead and author of PLANET DRUM (HarperSanFrancisco).An innovative and prolific musician, Jerry Garcia was the driving force behind that legendary band from the Haight-Ashbury scene of the 1960s, the Grateful Dead. It was a full-time job, as represented by 30-odd years spent touring. Turns out, Garcia also was a skilled visual artist. Now comes this collection featuring reproductions of his work and lending new insight into his boundless creativity. Garcia began drawing and painting while in high school. He dabbled in different mediums, and the book is divided into four categories: drawings, watercolors, acrylics, and digital. Interspersed are essays written by significant cultural figures and his closest friends. Particularly impressive are Garcia's line drawings (including fun caricatures), and much of his work in all media retains the graceful fluidity of an expressive squiggle. His watercolors and acrylics are as vibrant as one might expect but still surprise with their juxtaposition of seemingly incongruous colors. His exploration of the digital world reflects a fascination with things new. Overall, the joy Garcia found in this more private form of artistic expression shines through on every page. <i>Jerry Eberle</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Now, this brilliant writer offers a "short and combative" account of Ireland's astonishing transformation over the last three decades. <br> Has there really been an "economic miracle"? Where does the explosion of cultural energy in music, literature, and theater come from? Has the power of the Catholic Church really crumbled? Focusing largely on contemporary events, living people, current controversies, and popular culture, <em>Luck</em> <em>and the Irish</em> explores these questions and raises other provocative questions of its own. Foster looks at the astonishing volte-face undertaken by Sinn Fein, eventually taking office in a state they had once fought to destroy. He describes how Catholicism, once the bedrock of Irish identity, has been decisively compromised, as evidenced by the exploitation and abuse scandals and the drastic decline in devotions. At the same time, the position of women in Irish society has been transformed, with the growth of feminism, a revolution in sexual attitudes, far more women in the work force, the ascendancy of President Mary Robinson, and the movement of women to front-rank Cabinet posts--all of which have put the position of Irish women ahead of that in many European nations. <br> Many old molds have been broken in Irish society over the last 30 years, and the immediate results have been breath-taking. But are these developments really as permanent or even as beneficial as they appear? Everyone curious about the recent past, the burgeoning present, and the unclear future of Ireland will want to read this superbly written and deeply thoughtful book.</p><p><b>Amazon Best of the Month, March 2008</b>: Over the past three decades, Ireland has metamorphosed from a troubled-but-winsome bastion of the Old World to a thriving economic power known as the "Celtic Tiger." With the second highest per capita income in the EU, the Republic has come a long way from the days of its political argument that the Irish economy featured a potentially desirous "less costly standard of living." <i>Luck and the Irish</i> chronicles this Irish revival as historian R.F. Foster explains how a perfect storm of change produced present-day Ireland. Led by progressive thought, political transformations, and even a rock band from Dublin, the Irish broke through their own oppressive chains and took "the wearing o' the green" to a global level. While such success is due in part to good fortune--it is Ireland, after all--Foster paints an engaging portrait of a nation that is just now learning to stand on its own legs in today's international scene. <i>--Dave Callanan</i><br><strong>Roy Foster</strong> is Professor of History and a Fellow of Hertford College, Oxford.

Krishnamurti After He Came Into The Natural State (1967-71)</h2><p>In this book we meet with the modern sage, U.G. Krishnamurti, and listen to his penetrating voice describing life and reality as it is. What is body and what is mind? Is there a soul? Is there a beyond, a God? What is enlightenment? Is there a life after death? Never before have these questions been tackled with such simplicity, candour and clarity. In these unpublished early conversations with friends (1967-71), U.G.discusses in detail his search for the truth and how he underwent radical biological changes in 1967. Preferring to call it the natural state over enlightenment, he insists that whatever transformation he has undergone is within the structure of the human body and not in the mind at all. It is the natural state of being that sages like the Buddha, Jesus and, in modern times, Sri Ramana, stepped into. And U.G.never tires of pointing out that &#39;this is the way you, stripped of the machinations of thought, are also functioning.&#39;</p><p>Mukunda Rao is a professor of English and has been teaching in Bangalore for the last 31 years.He has participated and presented papers in several seminars on wide-ranging subjects such as Gandhian philosophy of social action and non-violence, Ambedkar, culture and politics,communalism, spirituality and religious harmony, and has been associated with organizations involved in the area of social justice and human rights.

With the cool logic of accreting snowflakes, his prose builds a world--a small U.S. town near Canada--and peoples it with four vivid, sensitive souls linked by a school-bus tragedy: the bus driver; the widowed Vietnam vet who was driving behind the bus, waving at his kids, when it went off the road; the perpetually peeved negligence lawyer who tries to shape the victims' heartaches into a winning case; and the beauty-queen cheerleader crippled by the crash, whose testimony will determine everyone's fate.<p>We experience the story from inside the heads of the four characters in turn--each knowing things the others don't, each misunderstanding the facts in his or her own way. The method resembles Faulkner's <i>The Sound and the Fury</i> and Gilbert Sorrentino's stunning <i>Aberration of Starlight</i>, but Banks's achievement is most comparable to John Updike's tales of ordinary small-towners preternaturally gifted with slangy eloquence, psychological insights, and alertness to life's tiniest details.</p><p> Egoyan's film is haunting but vague--it leaves viewers in the dark regarding several critical plot points. Banks's book is more haunting still, and precise, making every revelation count, with a finale far superior to that of the film. It's also wittier than the too-sober flick: the lawyer dismisses the dome-dwelling hippie parents of one of the crash victims as being "lost in their Zen Little Indians fantasy," which casts a sharp light on them and him, too. He's lost in his calculations of how each parent will fit into the legal system, and the ways in which he fits into the tragedy are lost on him. If only he and the Vietnam-vet dad could read each other's account of their tense first encounter, both of them might get what the other is missing. </p><p> Banks's wit is pitiless--it's painful when we discover that the bus driver, who prides herself on interpreting for her stroke-impaired husband, is translating his wise but garbled observations all wrong. The crash turns out not to be the ultimate tragedy: in the cold northern light of its aftermath, we discover that we're all in this alone.</p>"Russell Banks' work presents without falsehood and with a tough affection the uncompromising moral voice of our time. You find the craziness of false dreams, the political inequalities and somehow the silver of redemption. I trust his portrait of America more than any other -- the burden of it, the need for it, the hell of it." -- <i>Michael Ondaatje<br><br></i>"A writer of extraordinary power....

Hyman G. Rickover was a pivotal figure in twentieth-century American history. While many books have been written about various aspects of his career, this is the first biography to have access to private papers, family and close friends. It not only deals with the admiral's controversial naval career but with phases of his personal life that made him what he was, including his youth as a Jewish immigrant who embraced America and the opportunities it offered. The author, Francis Duncan, worked with Rickover from 1969, when he was assigned to write a history of the nuclear propulsion program, until the admiral's death in 1986. Shortly before he died, Rickover turned over his files to Duncan, including letters to his first wife that give a vivid picture of the Navy from 1929 to 1945. Rickover's second wife allowed Duncan access to letters covering important events later in his career.</p><br><p>The author was also granted interviews with the admiral's son and sister and with individuals from the Naval Reactors, an organization headed by Rickover whose members mostly had refused to talk to other biographers. A witness to the admiral's daily activities and the programs he directed, Duncan also drew on his own considerable knowledge to present a portrait of the man that gives new insights into Rickover's genius and short-comings. The book does not go into technical detail but focuses on the admiral's fights to build and extend the nuclear fleet and the often-difficult relationships that developed in the pursuit of the goal. He shows that Rickover's efforts had a profound effect on the postwar world, that the excellence and responsibility he demanded are qualities that reach beyond the Navy, and that his influence continues to be felt today.</p></p><p>Francis Duncan, a resident of Bethesda, Maryland, and Navy veteran of World War II, was a government historian for more than twenty years. His earlier book on the admiral, <i>Rickover and the Nuclear Navy</i>, published by the Naval Institute in 1990, focused on the admiral's approach to managing a technical program."...a very readable cruise..." -- <b><i>The Journal of American History</i></b><br><br>"This well-written biography traces Rickover's amazing 63-year career in the Navy." -- <b><i>Choice</i></b></p><h2>I&#39;m Big Now</h2><p>When you are big, you&#39;re not the baby any more, but sometimes you want to do the baby things you used to do before!

An abandoned prison, built originally as a fortress, and a few straggly crows squat on top of the crag. A Saracen lookout tower is perched on another rocky outcrop, a relic from the time when the town was an important strategic point dominating the road from the Sicilian capital Palermo to the island&#x2019;s southern coast. Wedged into a hillside, the steep streets are as narrow and twisted as entrails, regularly turned into furnaces by the hot, humid <i>scirocco</i> wind blowing from the Sahara.In his classic novel <i>The Leopard</i>, Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa described the harsh environment, which peasants like those of Corleone depended upon for a living: &#x2018;this landscape which knows no mean between sensuous sag and hellish drought; which is never petty, never ordinary, never relaxed, as a country made for rational beings to live in should be ... this climate which inflicts us with six feverish months at a temperature of 104�&#x2019;.In Corleone, the landscape boasts another negative feature: it has much to recommend it to criminals. The thick Ficuzza wood nearby, once the hunting ground of Bourbon kings and ideal hiding-place for cattle-rustlers, has long been popular with those in need of a secluded spot to bury the bodies of their victims. Overlooking Corleone, the 5,300-foot high Rocca Busambra mountain, dotted with limestone caves and narrow gorges, promises safe refuge to fugitives.Corleone, whose name is believed to derive from <i>Kurliyun</i> (Lionheart), an Arab fighter who conquered it in AD 840, has a proud tradition of standing up for its rights, and violently so; in the Sicilian Vespers of 1282, when the island rebelled against the French occupiers, Corleone killed more of the invaders than any other nearby town and earned the nickname &#x2018;the fiery one&#x2019;. One of the figures most venerated by the town&#x2019;s 14,000 inhabitants is Saint Bernard, revered not just for his holiness but for his sword-wielding past. A seventeenth-century cobbler, he became Sicily&#x2019;s most skilled swordsman, defending the poor and the womenfolk against rich aristocrats whom he challenged to duels, before becoming a Capuchin monk and spending the rest of his life repenting the blood he had spilt.The Catholic faith has always played an important role in the life of the town which once boasted some 60 churches and a dozen convents, and saw an incredible 74 saints paraded through the streets on the feast day of the Holy Sacrament. The crowds of the faithful walking behind each saint, borne shoulder-high, were so large that the dean and the mayor drew up in advance the order in which the saints were to be paraded and appointed a priest to regulate this holy traffic.It&#x2019;s no coincidence that the townspeople called Don Michele Navarra, the founding father of the Corleonese clan which was to overwhelm the mafia like no other in its history, &#x2018;<i>U Patri Nostru</i>&#x2019; (Our Father) &#x2013; just the way they referred to God. Like a deity the doctor, a short, corpulent figure with a bull-like neck and a broad, apparently kindly face, had the power of both life and death over every single one of them.<br><br>When Navarra was born in 1905, one of a land surveyor&#x2019;s eight children, life in Corleone hadn&#x2019;t changed for decades, even for centuries in many respects. His family was considered of a high social standing in a town of mainly peasants, shepherds and day-labourers. Poverty was so endemic that labourers who could boast ownership of not one but two mules were known as &#x2018;<i>i borgesi</i>&#x2019; &#x2013; &#x2018;the bourgeois&#x2019;. Most peasants lived in the same ground-floor room as their animals along with the odd pig or hen, often with only a curtain to separate them, allowing the smell of human sweat to mingle freely with the stench of the animals. Families cooked spaghetti and soup made from wild herbs in the bucket of water they also used to wash their feet. A goat was allowed to roam freely through the house as if it were a holy animal because its milk saved the children from dying of tuberculosis.At dawn, long lines of men on foot or riding on their mules would thread their way out of Corleone along roads of clayey, light brown earth, often travelling for two or three hours in the rugged landscape until they reached a rocky holding of wheat, vines or olives of at most four of five hectares spread among the yellow hills which turned dark brown when the peasants set fire to the common meadow grass. In the evenings the procession of men and mules would return home in time for the <i>Ave Maria</i> prayer, the exhausted peasants stopping at watering places at the entrances to the town so that the animals could drink while the dirt was washed off their legs and hooves.Navarra was considered privileged from birth not just because of his father&#x2019;s position, but also because of his family&#x2019;s links to a secret criminal association in Corleone. His uncle was a member of the Fratuzzi (&#x2018;the Brothers&#x2019;), a deceptively friendly label for the town&#x2019;s first mafiosi. First heard of in the early nineteenth century, the Fratuzzi&#x2019;s membership included authoritarian overseers who managed the estates of absentee landowners who preferred to live in Palermo 22 miles to the north. Armed private militiamen, who enforced order on the estates and didn&#x2019;t hesitate to use violence, also became part of the Fratuzzi.Navarra&#x2019;s uncle was among those who took part in an affiliation ritual conducted in the presence of the association&#x2019;s bosses. With a dagger, a small incision was made on the new recruit&#x2019;s lower lip, his blood dripping onto a piece of paper on which a skull had been drawn. The recruit then took the membership oath, pledging fidelity to the association. Members made themselves known to each other either with a password, or by touching the incisors in their upper jaw as if they had toothache. Such rituals would be quaint were it not for the misery the Fratuzzi inflicted on the town. They stole cattle, controlled the hiring of farmworkers and collected extortion money from landowners and shopkeepers in return for supposed &#x2018;protection&#x2019;. Kidnapping and arson were common punishments for anyone who dared to rebel.When and how, if at all, the Fratuzzi came to be part of the Sicilian mafia, itself born around 1860, remains a mystery. Even the origin of the word &#x2018;mafia&#x2019; remains obscure. Some believe its roots lie in the Arab domination of Sicily from 827 to 1061 and the Arabic word <i>mahias</i> (daring) or <i>Ma �fir</i> (the name of a Saracen tribe). In 1658, a witch mentioned in an official Palermo document was nicknamed <i>Maffia,</i> meaning she had a fiery character. In 1863 Palermitans flocked to the Sant&#x2019;Anna Theatre to see a new comedy, <i>I mafiusi di La Vicaria</i> (&#x2018;The mafiosi of Vicaria Prison&#x2019;), set in the city&#x2019;s jail and portraying members of a secret association &#x2013; it was never named in the play &#x2013; as virtually ruling the prison.Two years later, Marquis Filippo Antonio Gualtiero, the government&#x2019;s envoy to Palermo, described &#x2018;the so-called Maffia or criminal association&#x2019; as &#x2018;a large and long-standing sore&#x2019;. From then on, the word was in common usage and in 1875 two Tuscan sociologists carried out the first-ever investigation into the society. One of them, Leopoldo Franchetti, was at first stunned by the beauty of the Sicilian landscape but stories of terrible violence made him feel &#x2018;everything change around him little by little. The colours change, the appearance of things is transformed ... After a number of such stories, all that scent of orange and lemon blossom begins to smell of corpses.&#x2019;Navarra was only ten years old when his uncle is believed to have murdered, in 1915, the first local hero to have dared to take on the mafia. Corleone has given birth to a series of such courageous figures &#x2013; more than any other Sicilian town of similar size - as if in proportion to the influence of its mafiosi. Bernardino Verro was a Socialist founder of the Sicilian peasants&#x2019; movement which staged strikes and symbolic occupations of the land in an attempt to break the landowners&#x2019; hold. His courage and better judgement failed him temporarily in 1893 when he allowed the Fratuzzi to persuade him that enemies were intent on killing him. Believing that the association would save his life if he agreed to join them he submitted to the lip-pricking initiation ritual.It was a great coup for the Fratuzzi, anxious to preserve the established order which suited them well, and intent on crushing the rebellious peasant movements. But the coup soon backfired when Verro saw the methods they used. He promptly turned his back on the association and later described both the way it functioned and the secret ritual. Verro was the first to expose the mafia as a secret organisation with its own set of rules. Speaking to a crowd in a Corleone piazza, he courageously accused the mafiosi of turning it into &#x2018;the most wretched of Sicilian towns&#x2019;. Triumphantly elected mayor, he was murdered one year later.Those accused of his murder, among them Navarra&#x2019;s father, were all acquitted. Such courtroom victories were to become a triumphant trademark of the Fratuzzi&#x2019;s heirs &#x2013; the clan of the Corleonesi.<br><br>Navarra&#x2019;s parents appear to have done what they could to discourage their son from following in his uncle&#x2019;s footsteps. They ensured he got a good schooling in Corleone before sending him to Palermo to study medicine. After passing his exams, Navarra soon had himself appointed district doctor for Corleone, at a time when the Fascist regime of Benito Mussolini was making the fight against malaria and tuberculosis a priority. A decree ordered that all public offices and schools be equipped with spittoons but, because it was short of funds, the town hall could afford only seven.The young doctor returned to Corleone in time to witness another, much more ambitious campaign launched by Mussolini. Unable to tolerate any obstacle to his authority &#x2013; the mafia was both a state within a state and a challenge to his totalitarian vision - the dictator pledged to rid Sicily of it once and for all. &#x2018;We must no longer tolerate that a few hundred blackguards overwhelm, impoverish and harm a magnificient people like yours,&#x2019; he thundered during a short visit to Sicily.Mussolini picked as his anti-mafia supremo Cesare Mori, known as &#x2018;the Iron Prefect&#x2019; (a prefect is a government envoy) because of his brutal methods. When he galloped through the countryside hunting down bandits, he liked to shoot a few dead himself. He promised to eradicate the mafia &#x2018;as a surgeon penetrates the flesh with fire and steel, until he cauterises the pus sacks of the bubonic plague&#x2019;. At dawn five days before Christmas 1926, Mori spoilt Corleone&#x2019;s festivities by sending police to seal off the town and hunt down 150 suspects. Lists of names in hand and led by an enthusiastic municipal police chief, Mori&#x2019;s squads knocked on the doors of the mafiosi. When they found their man, handcuffs were clamped on his wrists and the squad chief pronounced the ritual formula: &#x2018;By order of His Excellency the Prefect Cesare Mori, I declare you under arrest!&#x2019;In a display typical of &#x2018;the Iron Prefect&#x2019;, the column of prisoners, handcuffed and in chains, was paraded down the main street on their way to prison in Palermo. The display was not as impressive as Mori would have wished. The police had failed to find more than half those named on their lists. Many mafiosi had fled to hide in the mountains, and as news of Mori&#x2019;s exploits spread some had even chosen to emigrate as far as America; one murderer, who had more experience of death than most of his new compatriots, set up a lucrative funeral parlour.Throughout Sicily, Mori exploited the mafiosi&#x2019;s so-called &#x2018;code of honour&#x2019; to put pressure on prisoners to make them confess their crimes and to persuade fugitives to turn themselves in. Mori sent police squads to squat the mafiosi&#x2019;s homes, which in the absence of the head of the household were often inhabited only by women and children. The squads would often stay until the mafioso, exasperated by the threat to his honour implicit in the enforced promiscuity between his woman and the policemen, confessed or gave himself up. Prisoners were tortured, forced to drink jugfuls of salted water, beaten with coshes or whipped, hit repeatedly on the testicles or given electric shocks. The women of suspects who had gone into hiding were raped.None of this appears to have shaken Dr Navarra&#x2019;s resolve to join the mafia. What exactly persuaded a young, small-town doctor with a safe, comfortable future ahead of him to take such a step &#x2013; a medical career spent saving lives could not contrast more sharply with a criminal one spent taking them? Judging by his later actions one likely explanation is that Navarra&#x2019;s main ambition was power. And in Corleone, the mafia was the fast track to power. Discreetly at first and then with increasing self-assurance, Navarra started to lobby for influence among the criminal organisation&#x2019;s local bosses, exploiting his uncle&#x2019;s connections.In an early display of unprincipled cunning, Navarra went to the Fascist authorities to inform on several bosses and &#x2018;soldiers&#x2019; (low-ranking members of the mafia) in nearby towns. This not only cleared the field of potential rivals but also allowed him to ingratiate himself with ruling politicians. To build himself a force of his own, Navarra formed his own clan, recruiting petty criminals and ex-convicts who had slipped through Mussolini&#x2019;s net.Plotting a criminal career didn&#x2019;t stop Navarra carrying out his more worthy duties at his surgery with professionalism and courtesy. He granted his patients many favours, readily referring them for a bed in a Palermo clinic or even waiving his fees. He willingly honoured families by acting as godfather at their children&#x2019;s baptisms and confirmations. Exploiting to the full the social prestige which his profession carried in a town as small and as poor as Corleone, he also made sure he had friends in the town hall and in the clergy, the latter always a force to reckon with there.The doctor&#x2019;s attentions all had a price. Although he never said so in so many words, everyone knew he expected unwavering allegiance in exchange for his favours. He had understood early on that to gain power inside the mafia, he needed the support &#x2013; or at least the tacit backing &#x2013; not only of its members but also of outsiders, preferably the notables of the town. Every walk Navarra took through town became a yardstick of his increasing influence; as he paced the clean high street or the smaller alleys where children chased each other barefoot among smears of muledung and pig-droppings, only the animals ignored him. Acquaintances showed him their respect, bowing their heads before bending to kiss his ring. People began to say of him that he could <i>sciusciare</i> (blow), which in the local dialect meant he radiated so much ominous authority that the very air seemed to move in his presence &#x2013; a quality usually only attributed to a mafioso.Despite Navarra&#x2019;s treacherous contribution to Mussolini&#x2019;s onslaught, the Corleone mafia soon recovered. Thanks to an amnesty and a decree commuting their sentences, many mafiosi returned home from prison and from the islands to which they had been exiled. When Mussolini himself visited Corleone on a trip to Sicily in 1937, the police urged the local Fascist party secretary to throw a few...</p><h2>Designs of Archibald Knox for Liberty &amp; Co.</h2><p>Some 200 illustrations of objects designed by Knox.</p><p></p><h2>The Keys to the Kingdom: How Michael Eisner Lost His Grip</h2><p><p>A riveting account of Michael Eisner's outrageous, thrilling, and often self-destructive tenure as head of the Walt Disney Company</p><p>Kim Masters, coauthor of the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller <em>Hit &amp; Run,</em> has written a page-turning account of Michael Eisner's ascent at The Magic Kingdom.

It is a critique of 19th-century rationalism and materialism, synthesising Oswald Spengler, Carl Schmitt, and Klaus Haushofer&#39;s geopolitics. In particular, it rethinks the themes of Spengler&#39;s The Decline of the West in an effort to account for the United States&#39; then recent involvement in World War II and for the task bequeathed to Europe&#39;s political soldiers in the struggle to unite the Continent-heroically, rather than economically-in the realisation of the destiny implied in European High Culture. Yockey&#39;s radical attack on liberal thought, especially that embodied by Americanism (distinct from America or Americans), condemned his work to obscurity, its appeal limited to the post-war fascist underground. Yet, Imperium transcents both the immediate post-war situation and its initial readership: it opened pathways to a deconstruction of liberalism, and introduced the concept of cultural vitalism- the organic conceptualisation of culture, with all that attends to it. These contributions are even more relevant now than in their day, and provide us with a deeper understanding of, as well as tools to deal with, the situation in the West in current century. It is with this in mind that the present, 900-page, fully-annotated edition is offered, complete with a major foreword by Dr. Kerry Bolton, Julius Evola&#39;s review as an afterword (in a fresh new translation), a comprehensive index, a chronology of Yockey&#39;s life, and an appendix, revealing, for the first time, much previously unknown information about the author&#39;s genealogical background.</p><p></p><h2>Crested Butte Colorado: 65 Scenic Day Hikes</h2><p>Why is hiking Crested Butte so special?.

We did not escape.<br>We were taken.<br>June 14, 1941. I had changed into my nightgown and settled in at my desk to write my cousin Joana a letter. I opened a new ivory writing tablet and a case of pens and pencils, a gift from my aunt for my fifteenth birthday.<br>The evening breeze floated through the open window over my desk, waltzing the curtain from side to side. I could smell the lily of the valley that Mother and I had planted two years ago. Dear Joana.<br>It wasn&#x2019;t a knocking. It was an urgent booming that made me jump in my chair. Fists pounded on our front door. No one stirred inside the house. I left my desk and peered out into the hallway. My mother stood flat against the wall facing our framed map of Lithuania, her eyes closed and her face pulled with an anxiety I had never seen. She was praying.<br>&#x201c;Mother,&#x201d; said Jonas, only one of his eyes visible through the crack in his door, &#x201c;are you going to open it? It sounds as if they might break it down.&#x201d;<br>Mother&#x2019;s head turned to see both Jonas and me peering out of our rooms. She attempted a forced smile. &#x201c;Yes, darling. I will open the door. I won&#x2019;t let anyone break down our door.&#x201d;<br>The heels of her shoes echoed down the wooden floor of the hallway and her long, thin skirt swayed about her ankles. Mother was elegant and beautiful, stunning in fact, with an unusually wide smile that lit up everything around her. I was fortunate to have Mother&#x2019;s honey-colored hair and her bright blue eyes. Jonas had her smile.<br>Loud voices thundered from the foyer.<br>&#x201c;NKVD!&#x201d; whispered Jonas, growing pale. &#x201c;Tadas said they took his neighbors away in a truck. They&#x2019;re arresting people.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No. Not here,&#x201d; I replied. The Soviet secret police had no business at our house. I walked down the hallway to listen and peeked around the corner. Jonas was right. Three NKVD officers had Mother encircled. They wore blue hats with a red border and a gold star above the brim. A tall officer had our passports in his hand.<br>&#x201c;We need more time. We&#x2019;ll be ready in the morning,&#x201d; Mother said.<br>&#x201c;Twenty minutes&#x2014;or you won&#x2019;t live to see morning,&#x201d; said the officer.<br>&#x201c;Please, lower your voice.

He proposed that Western theology since the early modern period had lost sight of the key to integrating faith and reason -- the truth that all human beings are naturally oriented toward the supernatural. In this vital book John Milbank defends de Lubac&#x2019;s claim and pushes it to a more radical extreme. <i>The Suspended Middle</i> shows how such a claim entails a &#x2018;non-ontology&#x2019; suspended between rational philosophy and revealed theology, interweaving the two while denying them any pure autonomy from each other. As de Lubac&#x2019;s writings on the supernatural implicitly dismantled the reigning Catholic (and perhaps Protestant) assumptions about Christian intellectual reflection, he met with opposition and even papal censure. Milbank&#x2019;s sophisticated account of de Lubac delineates the French theologian&#x2019;s relations with other proponents of the <i>nouvelle theologie</i>, such as Hans Urs von Balthasar, and clarifies the subtle but crucial divisions within recent Roman Catholic theology. The most substantial treatment in English of de Lubac&#x2019;s as yet untranslated <i>Surnaturel</i> and the subsequent debate, Milbank&#x2019;s <i>Suspended Middle</i> lays down an energetic challenge that every serious student of theology and Christian philosophy will want to engage.</p><p>John Milbank is Research Professor of Religion, Politics, and Ethics at the University of Nottingham, England, and Director of the Centre of Theology and Philosophy.

A brief biographical sketch is accompanied by a portrait of the artist and a half dozen photos representative of her work. In the 19th century, Julia Margaret Cameron developed the Pictorialist photographic style by which she sought to express the emotion of her subject rather than simply replicating its image. Margaret Bourke-White gained renown for her compelling pictures of industry and of the human condition, in peace and at war, as well as for the photo essay, which was the backbone of Life magazine. Initially, for these women, photography was a means of earning money to supplement meager resources, while the three contemporary photographers, Flor Gardu?o, Sandy Skoglund, and Lorna Simpson, approached photography as an outgrowth of interest in other art forms. Gardu?o focuses on examples of Hispanic culture. Skoglund and Simpson both go beyond careful composition for their work in that they create entire settings for their subjects. In the Skoglund image titled "Spirituality in Flesh," the walls, floor, mannequin, and stool on which the latter is seated are covered with hamburger. In similar fashion, Simpson's exhibitions or installments depend on elaborate arrangements, often complete with music. The author's challenge to her readers to devise new interpretations of the photographs extends the use of this book beyond recognition of style. Libraries can use this title for the basic information and as a springboard for interpretive discussions of photography as an art form.<br><i>Nancy E. Curran, Decatur Public Schools, IL</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.Gr. 5-8. Similar in format and approach to Sills' <i>Visions: Stories about Women Artists</i> , this profiles five women who view the creative process of photography from extraordinarily different perspectives. Daring, celebrated news photographer Margaret Bourke-White and Julia Margaret Cameron, known for her dramatic, iconoclastic nineteenth-century portraitures, are Wolf's nod to history, with Flor Gardu{�}no, Sandy Skoglund, and Lorna Simpson representatives of the art form now. Wolf smoothly mixes personal, evaluative, and technical information giving just enough to whet the appetite for more--which readers can locate through books suggested in the fine bibliography. The reproductions are crisp, glossy, and, generally, both excellent and well chosen. Particularly fascinating are those of African American Simpson's challenging pictorial social commentary and Skoglund's blazingly colorful, surrealistic photos, which take many months to set up. Best of all is Wolf's down-to-earth attitude toward photography as art. There's no snobbery or patronizing--just a fascinating view of what a medium can accomplish when imagination, daring, and skill come into play. <i>Stephanie Zvirin</i></p><h2>Black Dogs</h2><p>In 1946, a young couple set off on their honeymoon.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fired by their ideals and passion for one another, they plan an idyllic holiday, only to encounter an experience of darkness so terrifying it alters their lives forever.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this highly praised national bestseller, Ian McEwan has written his most humane and compelling novel to date.</p><p>Ian McEwan is the award-winning author of two collections of short stories and four novels.&nbsp;&nbsp;He lives in Oxford, England.In this slim, provocative novel, McEwan ( The Innocent ) examines the conflict between intellect and feeling, as dramatized in one couple's troubled relationship. The narrator is fascinated by his wife's estranged parents, The lives of June and Bernard Tremaine, whose lives epitomize the tug-of-war between political engagement and a private search for ultimate meaning: their ideological and spiritual differences force them apart but never diminish their mutual love. The catalytic event in the Tremaines' lives occurs on their honeymoon in France in 1946. With the characteristic idealism of their generation, both had joined the Communist Party, but June is already becoming disenchanted with its claims. In an encounter with two huge, ferocious dogs--incarnations of the savagely irrational eruptions that recur throughout history--she has an insight that illumines for her the possibility of redemption. Liberally foreshadowed, --the bloodthirsty beasts are used as an overarching metaphor for the presence of evil in the world-- the actual episode with the dogs is not depicted until the book's final section, where its impact requires the reader to take a leap of faith similar to June's. For some this pivotal scene may not be fully convincing. Indeed, McEwan is rather too didactic in the exposition of his theme, so one may expect too much from the novel's dramatic main event. Yet the work is impressive; McEwan's meticulous prose, his shaping of his material to create suspense, and his adept use of specific settings--Poland's Majdanek concentration camp, Berlin during the dismantling of the Wall, a primitive area of the French countryside--produce a haunting fable about the fragility of civilization, always threatened by the cruelty latent in humankind. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Cohousing Handbook: Building a Place for Community</h2><p><p>Cohousing offers an end to the isolation of the single-family suburban home.

At Cambridge University he formed a friendship with J. S. Henslow, a professor of botany, and that association, along with his enthusiasm for collecting beetles, led to &#x201c;a burning zeal,&#x201d; as he wrote in his&nbsp;<i>Autobiography</i>, for the natural sciences. When Henslow obtained for him the post of naturalist on H.M.S.&nbsp;<i>Beagle</i>, the course of his life was fixed. The five-year-long voyage to the Southern Hemisphere between 1831 and 1836 would lay the foundation for his ideas about evolution and natural selection. Upon his return Darwin lived in London before retiring to his residence at Down, a secluded village in Kent. For the next forty years he conducted his research there and wrote the works that would change human understanding forever. Knowing of the resistance from the orthodox scientific and religious communities, Darwin published&nbsp;<i>The Origin of Species</i>&nbsp;in 1859 only when another naturalist, Alfred Russel Wallace, independently reached the same conclusions. His other works include&nbsp;<i>The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex</i>&nbsp;(1871) and&nbsp;<i>Recollections of My Mind and Character</i>, also titled&nbsp;<i>Autobiography</i>&nbsp;(1887).

In addition to updating front and back matter in order to keep everything up to date, I make sure that any text changes that need to be made are indeed made. This could include anything from factual information that an author wants to change to simple misspellings (although we pride ourselves in having many books with zero typos). Well, recently I received a letter that had originally been sent from a reader to Faye Kellerman, who sent it on to us. The reader wrote about how much she loves Faye's books, and she was shocked to find a few typos in one of the books. I reviewed her list of "errors," and lo and behold, a couple of them absolutely had to be changed. Whenever a reader does something like this, I like to respond with a letter of my own, along with a copy of the book with the corrections made. But in this case there was only a return address; nowhere was there a name. I looked at the address again; it sounded awful familiar. I searched the remnants of my limited brain and suddenly realized that the letter had come from one of my best friends' mothers. And I could see Mrs. R's style all over it. I immediately called my friend and told him about it; we decided to do nothing until the next reprint comes out, with the corrections.

The biography of a brilliant orator and writer, and a politician who twice held the reins of power, it is also the spectacular story of the fall of the Roman Republic. Cicero&#39;s speeches and ideas have influenced European civilized values for two thousand years. Personally, he is accessible to us in his hundreds of letters, many of them to his dear friend Atticus. We are able to follow his busy life as a lawyer and politician, and the historic events in which he took part from day to day (sometimes from hour to hour) as he nervously prepares a speech to deliver in the Forum or to the Senate, detects the supposedly incorruptible Brutus in a financial scam, puts a stop to a sexual escapade of the young Mark Antony, steadies Rome at a moment of acute vulnerability following Julius Caesar&#39;s assassination, vainly tries to prevent civil war...or, at more private moments, entertains dinner parties with his wit or irons out a problem with his wayward nephew. In this account of Cicero&#39;s career from his provincial origins - he was never entirely accepted by Rome&#39;s ruling class - to his tragic end as the Republic he revered crashed round his ears, Anthony Everitt makes full use of Cicero&#39;s own words and those of his contemporaries. The figure that emerges is intensely human - often dithering and uncertain, boastful from inner insecurity, emotional enough, beneath a near-Stoic exterior, to wander through the woods weeping in a way then thought unmanly when his daughter died in childbirth. This biography intimately and convincingly brings to life the man whose name has become emblematic of the last days of Republican Rome.</p><p>Anthony Everitt was Deputy Secretary-General of the Arts Council of Great Britain from 1985 to 1990, and Secretary-General until 1994. His fascination with ancient Rome began when he studied classics at school, and his particular interest in Cicero crystallized years later when he explored the Forum on regular visits to Rome. He lives in Colchester.&#39;Uobtrusively crammed with fascinating information about Roman life and customs, splendidly clear and coherent in its narrative and altogether convincing in its portraiture&#39; -- Anthony Cronin, Sunday Independent</p><h2>Celebrating with Julienne</h2><p><p>This award-winning, regionally best-selling cookbook is flat-out gorgeous. And the food is amazing, too. Author Susan Campoy spent thirty years as one of Los Angeles&#x2019; most in-demand caterers, and her Julienne bistro in San Marino hasn&#x2019;t had an empty seat in two decades. Completed just before Campoy died of breast cancer in 2009, <i>Celebrating with Julienne </i>showcases the most beloved recipes from her career: Cr�me Br�l�e French Toast, Carrot Ginger Soup, Beef Daube, Lemon Coconut Bars, and so much more, including holiday, party, and picnic menus. All royalties go to City of Hope.</p></p><p>Good food was always a family affair for Susan Campoy. She absorbed the basics of cooking from her parents her mother made preserves and desserts from the fruit from their two-acre Southern California orchard, and her father owned a downtown Los Angeles cafe. Although trained as a teacher, as a young wife and mother she fell in love with cooking and baking, especially preparing food for celebrations: dinner parties, holidays, family gatherings. <br><br> In the 1970s, her passion for cooking led to studies at La Varenne, Cordon Bleu and Lenotre in France and at Ma Cuisine in Los Angeles, as well as travels to explore the culinary cultures in France and Italy. This passion inspired a catering business, a French-California bistro, and a gourmet market, all under the Julienne umbrella and all of which have earned acclaim from everyone from Bon Appetit to the New York Times. <br><br> The mother of four daughters and grandmother of two girls, Campoy lived in San Marino, California, within walking distance of Julienne. She died not long after finishing the book, after a 14-year battle with breast cancer.</p><h2>Where Our Food Comes From: Retracing Nikolay Vavilov&#39;s Quest to End Famine</h2><p>The future of our food depends on tiny seeds in orchards and fields the world over. In 1943, one of the first to recognize this fact, the great botanist Nikolay Vavilov, lay dying of starvation in a Soviet prison. But in the years before Stalin jailed him as a scapegoat for the country&#x2019;s famines, Vavilov had traveled over five continents, collecting hundreds of thousands of seeds in an effort to outline the ancient centers of agricultural diversity and guard against widespread hunger. Now, another remarkable scientist&#x2014;and vivid storyteller&#x2014;has retraced his footsteps.<br> &nbsp;<br> In Where Our Food Comes From, Gary Paul Nabhan weaves together Vavilov&#x2019;s extraordinary story with his own expeditions to Earth&#x2019;s richest agricultural landscapes and the cultures that tend them. Retracing Vavilov&#x2019;s path from Mexico and the Colombian Amazon to the glaciers of the Pamirs in Tajikistan, he draws a vibrant portrait of changes that have occurred since Vavilov&#x2019;s time and why they matter.<br> &nbsp;<br> In his travels, Nabhan shows how climate change, free trade policies, genetic engineering, and loss of traditional knowledge are threatening our food supply. Through discussions with local farmers, visits to local outdoor markets, and comparison of his own observations in eleven countries to those recorded in Vavilov&#x2019;s journals and photos, Nabhan reveals just how much diversity has<br> already been lost. But he also shows what resilient farmers and scientists in many regions are doing to save the remaining living riches of our world.<br> &nbsp;<br> It is a cruel irony that Vavilov, a man who spent his life working to foster nutrition, ultimately died from lack of it. In telling his story, Where Our Food Comes From brings to life the intricate relationships among culture, politics, the land, and the future of the world&#x2019;s food.</p><p>Gary Paul Nabhan is a world-renowned ethnobiologist, conservationist, and&nbsp;essayist.

(<i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>"<i>Where Our Food Comes From</i> is a marked critique of the worldwide simplification of agricultural systems. It pins its hopes on local, traditional agriculture and is sceptical of top-down approaches to increasing food production, such as calls for another 'green revolution'." (<i>Nature</i>)<br><br>"Equal parts travelog, biography and botanical history, Nabhan breathes life into the exploits of Russia's botanical adventurer." (<i>Science News</i>)<br><br>"The book pays homage to a martyr who understood that crop varieties must be preserved for the future food security of the human race. As Nabhan points out, the risk today is no less than in Vavilov's time, and it may be greater." (<i>Washington Post Book World</i>)<br><br>"In this incredible tale that leaves you wanting more, Nabhan spices up his narrative with sprinkles of historical detail, and shows history's impact on food production and, subsequently, the food security of nations...part history book, part travelogue, and part detailed scientific explanation of why our planet's survival depends on maintaining and guarding the biodiversity of plant life. Not one of these ingredients is any less appealing than the others. Dig in and enjoy it." (<i>Earth Island Journal</i>)<br><br>"A blend of travelogue and biography, Nabhan's book is a sobering reminder that while food is necessary for our survival, it is not always easy to come by, nor is access to food completely under our control." (<i>Bloomsbury Review</i>)<br><br>"Any book with ethnobotanist Nabhan's name on it is going to be worth a read but this one's a grabber. A thriller, a tragedy and self-help&#x2014;all in one."

(<i>Ecosalon</i>)<br><br>"<i>Where Our Food Comes From</i> is an urgent reminder that we must work to save not only the seeds that feed us but the farmers who grow and select them&#x2014;those 'vernacular plant breeders' on whom the long-term vitality of those seeds and a diverse agriculture depends."

Nowadays he is regarded as the founder of abstract art and is, moreover, the chief theoretician of this type of painting. Together with Franz Marc and others he founded the group of artists known as the &#34;Blauer Reiter&#34; in Munich. His art then freed itself more and more from the object, eventually culminating in the &#34;First Abstract Watercolour&#34; of 1910. In his theoretical writings Kandinsky repeatedly sought the proximity of music; and just as in music, where the individual notes constitute the medium whose effect stems from harmony and euphony, Kandinsky was aiming for a pure concord of colour through the interplay of various shades. Gauguin had demanded that everything &#34;must be sacrificed to pure colours&#34;. Kandinsky was the first to realize this and thus to influence a whole range of artists.</p><p></p><h2>Father Charles Coughlin: The Life of the Controversial Catholic Priest Who Revolutionized Radio</h2><p>*Includes pictures *Includes Coughlin's own quotes about the politics of the era *Includes online resources and a bibliography for further reading *Includes a table of contents &#x201c;The people have spoken and the only American thing to do is abide by the will of the people." &#x2013; Father Coughlin Traditionally in American culture, members of the clergy have been among the most trusted people in the nation, while politicians have been the least trusted. So, one might ask, what happens when these two classes collide and come in the form of one person? The result, it appears from history, is rarely all good, perhaps due to the difficulty of reconciling the moral high ground with political mud. Another reason why the political clergyman is usually a failure is that each of the world&#x2019;s major religions has its own identity, culture and even language, and it is often very hard for those outside that culture to understand what a member of the group means by what he is saying. This leaves the door open for misunderstanding and hostility, some of it by design and some by accident. For whatever reasons, clergymen rarely make good politicians, and there is perhaps no better example of this than Father Charles Coughlin, a Depression Era priest turned demagogue who was seen as an angel to some and a devil to others. Both viewpoints had plenty of reasons for their perspectives, for the same man who cruelly castigated the Jews also spoke eloquently on the needs and rights of the most downtrodden in society. The same orator who said, &#x201c;Roosevelt or Ruin&#x201d; later cried, &#x201c;Roosevelt and Ruin.&#x201d; He was a radio priest who came to power after being victimized by the Ku Klux Klan and then used his power to spread racial hatred against others. He was a highly political Catholic who hated the first Catholic presidential candidate in American history. Coughlin has always been a slippery subject to wrap one&#x2019;s mind around, and this was so even at the height of his power, but nobody can deny his influence. In the 1930s, his effective use of the radio revolutionized mass communications, and millions of people listened to his every word. It would have been impossible for well known televangelists and religious figures like Jerry Falwell and Billy Graham to rise to national prominence without Coughlin setting the precedents decades earlier. Father Charles Coughlin: The Life of the Controversial Catholic Priest Who Revolutionized Radio chronicles the colorful life of one of the most famous priests in American history. Along with pictures of important people, places, and events, you will learn about Father Coughlin like never before, in no time at all.</p><p></p><h2>American Furniture: Understanding Styles, Construction, and Quality</h2><p>An authority on the history of American furniture offers a wide-ranging guide to this art form, discussing three hundred years of style changes, including Shaker, Modern, and Revival, and showing how to appraise the quality and authenticity of pieces. 10,000 first printing.

Her mother, the queen, is especially frazzled when the popular story is loaded onto the Web, a weightless, "virtual" world of unforeseen challenges. </p><p>To cope with the stress, Sylvie convinces the Writer to add a new character, who gives yoga instruction to the storybook's cast in those moments when they have time off. But stress proves the least of their problems as strange things start happening -- words get changed around, scenes disappear -- and Sylvie and her friends must launch themselves into the labyrinth of cyberspace to confront a twenty-first-century evil that threatens to destroy their world.</p></p><p><b>Roderick Townley</b>'s first book about Sylvie, <i>The Great Good Thing</i>, was a Top-Ten Book Sense Pick, praised by <i>Kirkus Reviews</i> as "utterly winning...a book beloved from the first page." Its sequel, <i>Into the Labyrinth</i>, was hailed by the <i>New York Times</i> as "a hopping fine read." The present volume completes the Sylvie cycle. <p>Mr. Townley has also published the novel <i>Sky</i>, described by VOYA as "one hell of a book," as well as volumes of poetry, nonfiction, and literary criticism. He has two children, Jesse and Grace, and is married to author Wyatt Townley.</p><p><b>Chapter One</b> </p><p> "She's about to jump!" shouted Riggeloff. </p><p> "Cree! Skricket!" cried the thieves, as they turned into insects. </p><p> "You're twelve years old," intoned the queen. "It's time to think of marriage!" </p><p> The voices echoed all around her, till sometimes the girl wanted to put her hands over her ears. Still, it was a delicious noise. Sylvie had an amazing life, and she got to live it dozens of times a day, now that the book she lived in was back in print. </p><p> Her life, in print again! For years, there had been one known copy of her story, and it sat on a shelf in the second-floor bedroom of an old house. But now, through what seemed a miracle, the book was republished, and Sylvie suddenly found herself in living rooms and waiting rooms, apartments, bus stations, and the windows of bookstores. </p><p> Whatever a bookstore was. As far as she knew, <i>The Great Good Thing</i> was the only book in the world. Readers appeared above her with great regularity, their enormous faces peering down into her storybook world of villains and ladies-in-waiting, of spells and narrow escapes. The idea that they might also peer down into other stories never occurred to her. And if it hadn't occurred to <i>her,</i> it would never occur to her parents, king and queen of the realm, whose imaginations were limited to the words written for them. Finally it was Norbert Fangl, her tutor, who broke the news as they strolled one night by the Mere of Remind. A bony old fellow with sadly smiling eyes, Fangl was almost the only character in the story who was based on an actual person. In life he had been a geometry teacher, and he seemed to know everything, or could figure it out. Still, Sylvie didn't want to believe him. </p><p> "Does it disturb you, Princess," he said, "to think there might be other books?" </p><p> Sylvie thought. "It does. It's like being told there are other suns in the sky." </p><p> "There <i>are</i> other suns in the sky. Millions of them." </p><p> Sylvie laughed, her young cheeks bunching up. "Now you're making fun of me, Fangl." </p><p> He smiled kindly. "Am I going too fast?" </p><p> "You're not going fast, you're just talking silly." </p><p> "I'm sure you're right, Your Highness." </p><p> They continued along the curve of the shore, Sylvie doing a happy skip and not caring that mud was splashing her shoes. Tired though she was, she liked these midnight walks, when most Readers were asleep and the characters had time to themselves. The moon, always full, cast lines of wiggling silver over the water. Across the inlet lay the castle grounds with their woods and moonlit paths, and beyond them the dark turrets of the great structure itself. The distant moat gleamed weakly, sheeted with lilies, while over the whole scene drifted the delicious scent of newly printed pages. </p><p> "Although if there <i>are</i> other stories," said Sylvie, picking up the thread, "I'd like to know how the people in them deal with all these Readers. I hardly have time to catch my breath!" </p><p> "Most books are not as popular as <i>The Great Good Thing."</i> </p><p> "Really?" Sylvie felt pleased by the thought. "Really?" she said again. Her green eyes sparkled. </p><p> Just then a nearby bullfrog began a loud croaking. "Oooopen!" it belched. "Booook oopen!" </p><p> "Isn't it a little late for people to be reading?" said Sylvie with a little puff of a sigh. "Oh well." She gave her tutor a quick wave and hurried toward page 5 of the new edition, where her dialogue with the king began. </p><p> <i>"Skraawk!"</i> cried an orange-and-white bird, taking off from a rock. "Reader!" </p><p> "I know, I know!" cried Princess Sylvie, racing down the narrow white path between lines of words. She arrived, panting a little, just as the moon and several clouds lifted away and a boy's face appeared overhead, backlit by a reading lamp. </p><p> "Father," Sylvie declared in a firm voice, "I cannot marry Prince Riggeloff." </p><p> The king's crown was crooked and he had a cross look on his face. Evidently, he'd been napping in the anteroom. "Not marry Riggeloff?" he grumped. "For Heaven's sake, child, he is handsome, rich..." </p><p> "Kind, brave," continued Princess Sylvie. "Yes, I am aware of his qualities." </p><p> So it went, Sylvie refusing to marry before she did one "great good thing" with her life, Prince Riggeloff's bitter reaction, his thieves' stealing the castle treasure, the invisible fish saving Sylvie when she leapt from the cliff, the horrid-looking Keeper of the Cave urging the princess to kiss the wound on his forehead. Fortunately, the Reader yawned loudly and let the book close before the start of Part Three. Part Three was the most demanding section of all. </p><p> The moon came back on again, full as ever. </p><p> "Who on Earth was that?" snapped Pingree the Jester, a short, spindly fellow with a face like a walnut. </p><p> "A sixth-grader, I believe," said Norbert Fangl, "from a place called Kansas." </p><p> "Don't <i>they</i> sleep in Kansas?" </p><p> "Just wait," replied Fangl. "When the Japanese translation is finished, we'll have Readers all through the night." </p><p> "Don't they sleep?" </p><p> "Difference in time zones. They sleep when other Readers are awake. It's fourteen hours later there." </p><p> Fangl noticed the other characters were staring at him. "It's simple, really. You see, the curve of the Earth..." </p><p> "Oh joy!" muttered Pingree. He swatted his jingling cap against his leg and set it at an angle on his head. </p><p> "We'll get no rest at all!" the queen faintly wailed. </p><p> Fangl looked about him in surprise. </p><p> Sylvie whispered, "I'm not sure you should have brought up all that about translations. Now they've got something else to worry about." </p><p> "Good thing I didn't mention the Urdu and Icelandic." </p><p> "Are we going to have to learn all those languages?" </p><p> "It seems not. You're already in several European languages and no one seems to have noticed." </p><p> "We <i>are?"</i> </p><p> "You think in whatever language you're written in." </p><p> "Fangl, you are full of surprises." </p><p> "Um, excuse me, old fellow," said King Walther, draping an arm around the old teacher's shoulder and drawing him aside. He gnawed on the end of his mustache, as he always did when he fretted. "Explain to me again about this time-zone business." </p><p> Slowly the characters drifted off, each in his own direction, to get a little rest before the day began and new Readers opened the book. </p><p> "Sylvie," hissed Queen Emmeline, when they were alone. </p><p> "Mother, are you all right? Your eyebrow is twitching." </p><p> The queen, she noticed, was wearing more makeup these days, to disguise her lack of sleep. "You've <i>got</i> to talk with the Writer. Get her to do something!" </p><p> "What's the matter?" </p><p> "The matter?" The queen closed her eyes and shook her head a fraction of an inch. "This jumping up and down every five minutes, that's what's the matter." </p><p> Sylvie put a calming hand on her mother's arm. "I know we've been pretty busy lately." </p><p> "Busy! My dear, a queen likes to sit on her throne and reign, not scamper about like a...like a...whatnot!" She picked up her little brown-and-white Chihuahua and patted its head. "Even Lulu is nervous." </p><p> "Lulu is always nervous." </p><p> "Yesterday she barked through my whole scene by the drawbridge." </p><p> "I'll see if I can talk to the Writer." </p><p> "If you do see her," the queen went on, "ask if she can do something about this awful gown. I don't know what's wrong with it; it just <i>hangs</i> on me." </p><p> "You've lost weight, Mother." </p><p> The queen raised an eyebrow doubtfully, then glanced in the looking glass at the trailing gown of green silk. "Do you suppose?" </p><p> "It's obvious." </p><p> "I've never lost an ounce before." </p><p> "You've never been so busy before. You should see Prince Riggeloff. With all his racing around, he's practically swimming in his clothes." </p><p> The queen considered this. "I was wondering what was different about him. He's always looked so snappy." </p><p> "It's hard to be snappy when you're tripping over your cape." </p><p> The queen gave one of her rare smiles. "He did trip, didn't he?" </p><p> "I'll talk to the Writer," continued Sylvie, "if I can get her attention." </p><p> "Thank you, child." </p><p> "Try to rest. Things will be starting up soon." </p><p> Queen Emmeline nodded, but she wasn't listening. She was looking in the mirror. "I can see why you're the heroine," she said, in better spirits. "You always see the bright side. And those lines of dialogue! I could never manage saying all that." </p><p> "You get used to it." </p><p> "I'm too old to get used to it." Cradling the squirming dog, she glided off to her chambers. Princess Sylvie watched her go. She'd promised that she'd speak to Lily -- that was the Writer's name -- but meetings weren't easy to arrange. You couldn't just tilt your head back and shout. She had to wait till Lily had a dream that Sylvie could be part of. That happened less and less frequently, and Sylvie found it wise to make a list of things to bring up when they happened to be together. </p><p> "Mother frazzled," she scribbled. "Can she have fewer lines?" Then she wrote, "Alterations?" and slid the note into the pocket of her velvet dress. </p><p> The person she really wanted to talk to was the girl with the dark blue eyes. She always knew what to do. She might not be a whiz at logic, like Fangl, but she just knew things. Even the king consulted her. Where was she? </p><p> Sylvie stood fingering the gold locket that the girl had given her long ago. The princess clicked it open. There was her friend: the bright, almond-shaped face looking as if it could barely contain a secret, the suggestion of a smile playing about her small mouth. And those eyes, dark blue, undecided between mischief and mystery. Sylvie snapped the locket shut, absentmindedly rubbing the gold <i>S</i> on the lid. </p><p> The next day was busier than ever. It started with a librarian in Cleveland reading through most of Part One faster than Sylvie had ever known Readers could read. Whoever librarians were, they sure could zip through a book! The characters kept up as best they could, but the king's knights were sweating as they raced around in heavy armor pursuing Riggeloff and his thieves. In the midst of this madness, a very young girl in Maine opened the book with soft fingers and began sounding out the words of Chapter One: "'Father,' said Princess Sylvie, 'I cannot marry Prince Rig. Rigga.' Mommy, what's this word?" </p><p> At about the same time, a boy waiting for a school bus in Hackensack, New Jersey, fished the book out of his backpack and started reading where he'd left off the night before. Unfortunately, it was raining in Hackensack that morning, and cold droplets kept plunking down in the bedchamber during Queen Emmeline's scene with Sylvie. Finally the school bus pulled up and the book was shoved in the backpack. </p><p> "Sylvie," the queen hissed, "you've <i>got</i> to talk to the Writer!" </p><p> "First chance I get, Mother." </p><p> "It's not just me. Everyone's miserable. We can't keep up this pace." </p><p> "I know, Mother." </p><p> "How can you be so cheery?" </p><p> "I guess I'm just happy to have a book to live in again. There were all those years when we didn't." </p><p> "I hardly remember. That time is vague to me." </p><p> Sylvie looked at her mother with surprise. It was all so <i>vivid.</i> "Surely you remember when that boy Ricky set fire to the book we were living in." </p><p> Queen Emmeline frowned and nodded. "I think so," she said slowly. </p><p> "Ricky. Claire's brother <i>Ricky.</i> He was trying to make the pages look old by burning the edges, but then the whole book caught fire." </p><p> "That's right, and we escaped somehow." </p><p> "We escaped into his sister's memory." </p><p> "Was she that unattractive little girl?" </p><p> "Claire was a wonderful friend and she saved us. I would never call her unattractive." </p><p> "My dear, she had a very wide mouth and mousy little curls." </p><p> "She kept us in her memory for years when we had no book to live in. And when she grew up, she told our story to her daughter, Lily." </p><p> "I'm not saying she wasn't a fine person." </p><p> "And when Lily grew up -- " </p><p> "She wrote it down, yes. And here we are." </p><p> "Yes, Mother, here we are." </p><p> "A fine kettle of fish!" </p><p> Sylvie sighed. "Would you prefer the old days, when there was only one copy of the book and no one read us for ages at a time?" </p><p> "Much." </p><p> "Really?" </p><p> "Much-much-much." </p><p> Sylvie sighed. "Well, I'll talk to the Writer when I see her. Maybe she can cut back on your lines. But I can't promise." </p><p> As luck had it, Sylvie ran into the Writer that very night. Lily was not dreaming about the book exactly, but about something called a "talk show," which was to take place in a few days. From what Sylvie gathered from the dream, Lily was scheduled to discuss <i>The Great Good Thing</i> and how she had first heard the story from her mother, who had read it in a book <i>her</i> grandmother had owned decades before. Lily was always careful not to take credit for coming up with the plot. </p><p> Still, Lily admitted, it was gratifying to have an actual book in print and to see her own name on it. The money made a welcome change, too. Lily was able to buy a new computer to write on, and she immediately got herself hooked up to the Internet. </p><p> In the dream, Lily, looking pretty in a maroon pants suit and cream-colored blouse, was talking with a chuckling fellow with an upturned chin and his hair in a big, graying pompadour. The place didn't look a thing like the castle; there was not a turret or unicorn tapestry in sight. Instead of thrones, three chairs and a desk stood on a carpeted stage. Instead of armor, strange machines glided silently about, pointing first at the pleasant man with the puffy hair, then at Lily. This was one of Lily's Nervous Dreams, Sylvie realized, noticing numbers of brown mice nibbling at the gold fringe of the curtain and scooting along the backs of the chairs. One of the mice crept across the man's desk and stood on its hind legs to peer into his coffee cup. </p><p> When Lily was having one of her Nervous Dreams, you could never tell <i>what</i> might happen. Still, the man kept smiling. He spoke right at one of the gliding machines, and then leaned toward Lily confidingly. </p><p> "I just loved your invisible fish!" He chuckled and shook his head. "How did you come up with that one?" </p><p> Lily was smiling, but Sylvie saw the alarm in her eyes. "I didn't. Really!" A mouse poked its nose out of the sleeve of her blouse. Another crept up her neck. "That was just part of the story my mother told me." An electric saw backstage began screaming so loudly Lily couldn't hear herself speak. </p><p> "Look," she shouted over the hubbub, "here's Princess Sylvie now. She'll tell you!" </p><p> That was Sylvie's cue. A young assistant gave her a gentle shove, and she stepped onto the brightly lit platform while applause welled up around her. Sylvie was used to dreams, having appeared in enough of them in the past, so she threw herself into the part, happy to help Lily out, and especially happy to say lines that hadn't been pre-written for her.

The author states that God&#39;s activity is central to the development of a doctrine of Baptism, and in support of this thesis he considers the historical antecedents and the origin of Christian Baptism, as well as the New Testament statements regarding this sacrament. The book explores God&#39;s activity in Baptism, including the giving of new life; reception into the church; and the interaction of the Word, washing. and God. It also delves into the development of the Trinitarian formula. The author also addresses the administration and reception of Baptism, clarifies &#34;heretical Baptism,&#34; and looks at infant Baptism, including its origin, rejection, and current practice.</p><p>Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>Our Little Kat King: A MUTTS Treasury (Volume 20)</h2><p>New York Times best-selling author Patrick McDonnell&#x2019;s comic strip Mutts has been charming fans since its creation in 1994 with its simple, sparse drawings and big heart.&#x201c;Patrick McDonnell&#x2019;s MUTTS is up there with Peanuts, Pogo, Krazy Kat, and Calvin and Hobbes-cartoons that are smart and funny, brilliantly drawn and full of heart.&#x201d;&#x2014;MATT GROENIG, creator of The SimpsonsMUTTS is "one of best comic strips of all time." &#x2014;CHARLES SCHULZ, creator of Peanuts &#x201c;MUTTS evokes an effervescent bliss, drawn from a century-old tradition, dating from Buster Brown to Charlie Brown that, in an instant, turns words and pictures into poetic-play.&#x201d; &#x2014;JULES FEIFFER, cartoonist<br><br>Inside <i>Our Little Kat King</i>, <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Patrick McDonnell presents his 15th chronological collection of <i>Mutts</i> strips.

How can I save money?<br>A: Though tucked away in the South Pacific, New Zealand prices are comparable to those of Europe and North America--though even visitors from these regions may still find things like alcohol and petrol to be expensive. But there are plenty of good quality lodgings for those on a budget, and heaps of bars that run happy hours and restaurants that allow you to bring your own wine, known as BYOs. Moon New Zealand has websites with last minute discounts on everything from sights to flights, while those visiting outside peak season are also more likely to score some deals on hotels and attractions. New Zealand's biggest draws--its beautiful beaches and backcountry--are all free.<br><b></b><br><br>Q: What sort of clothing should I pack?<br>A: New Zealand is pretty casual, though it doesn't hurt to pack a couple of smart shirts or dresses. Biblical downpours can occur even in the height of summer--you don't get a country this beautiful without a bit of precipitation-so always make sure you've got a lightweight rain jacket in your backpack, and an extra layer if you're hiking. Other essentials include walking shoes or good sneakers, a sunhat, and plenty of sunscreen--little air pollution and a thin ozone layer in this part of the world make for some unforgiving UV blasts.<br>Q: What's the best time of year to visit?<br>A: The hottest and generally driest time is during the peak season in summer--remember the seasons are reversed in the southern hemisphere, so our summer stretches from December to February. Most Kiwis take their main holiday in late December/early January, so it's a busy time throughout the country. Either side, the weather's still great during the shoulder seasons of fall and spring, with less crowds and more discounts on hotels and attractions. On South Island especially there's plenty of snow during winter--and heaps of world class ski fields that cater to all levels.<br>Q: Do I need a visa?<br>A: There is currently a visitor visa waiver agreement with the US, Canada, Australia, and many European countries, meaning no visas are required. However, a proposal to introduce a one-off $35 tourist levy is proving popular and may be introduced sometime in 2019. The money would be used for maintaining tourist infrastructure and national parks, but visitors from Australia and the Pacific Islands will be exempt.<br>Q: What's the best way to get around? Should I rent a car?<br>A: Air travel can be costly, and trains are limited. There's a super nationwide bus network, and most of the more remote locations are well serviced by shuttles also. However, I would absolutely recommend renting a car or campervan. Not only is it more convenient, but you'll get to savor the joy of experiencing a country of everchanging, spectacular scenery that looks as though it was carved out especially for road tripping.<br>Q: Is New Zealand a safe place for solo travel?<br>A: Solo travelers should always take the usual precautions, but for some peace of mind it's worth remembering that in 2017 the Global Peace Index ranked New Zealand as the second safest country in the world. Kiwis are a staggering laid back and optimistic bunch who take great pride in their beautiful nation and welcoming overseas guests--scenery aside, among your fondest memories will be the people.<br>Q: Is tipping customary in New Zealand?<br>A: Kiwis certainly don't work for tips and you're pretty much guaranteed friendly service whether you tip or not. However, though tipping is not customary, it's certainly very much appreciated if you do.<br>Q: What should I absolutely not miss on my trip?<br>A: New Zealand is so magical because its wildly varied landscapes of towering mountains, volcanoes, rainforests, fiords and tropical beaches are crammed into a really manageable area that allows guests--especially those with their own transport--to pack so much into their vacation. Top of the to-dos should be: experiencing some Maori culture; cruising or kayaking the "Eight Wonder of the World" Milford Sound; visiting North Island's geothermal heart; and scaring yourself senseless in Queenstown, the adventure capital of the world. There's a wealth of world-renowned wineries and microbreweries where you can kick back in between the adventuring, too.<br></p><h2>Rare Views</h2><p>The award-winning, Thai-born photographer offers his follow up to his successful 2004 debut, Rough Stuff.

The problem is that these drugs are also incredibly addictive. Misuse of and addiction to prescription pain medications has become America's latest, complex, and alarming drug abuse trend. In fact, an estimated 2.6 million people currently use prescription pain relievers non-medically-a dangerous practice that could quickly reach epidemic proportions. Best-selling author Drew Pinsky, M.D., and five other leading experts offer practical, plainspoken, and much-needed information about addiction to painkilling drugs. They will help you understand:How addiction to painkilling medication developsWhat to do if a family member is addictedWhat happens in addiction treatmentWhy addiction is a family disease</p><p>Drew Pinsky, M.D., author of the best-selling book Cracked: Putting Lives Together Again, is program medical director of chemical dependency services at Las Encinas Hospital in Pasadena, California.

He is also well known for his work as a correspondent for ABC news, Good Morning America, and as a regular contributor for CNN.Though OxyContin provides effective, long-acting relief from pain, it has its dark side, Rush Limbaugh&#x2019;s addiction being only one of the examples of it. OxyContin is an opioid and thus addictive, and if used in conjunction with alcohol or other drugs, it can be deadly. Pinsky, an expert in chemical dependency and co-host of MTV&#x2019;s Loveline, offers a sober and plainly written introduction to OxyContin and other new painkillers, including how they work and how they are abused. In a brief but comprehensive overview, Pinsky, along with several other experts, explains how painkillers mimic our own endorphins, how addiction affects the brain and how it can be treated (simple abstinence is not enough). He also offers advice to those who think a friend or family member might be addicted and describes the role of family in addiction and treatment.

The Germans have unaccountably changed their U-boat Enigma code, threatening a massive Allied defeat. And as suspicion grows that there may be a spy inside Bletchley, Jericho's girlfriend, the beautiful and mysterious Claire Romilly, suddenly disappears.<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><p>A gripping World War II mystery novel with a cryptographic twist, <i>Enigma</i>'s hero is Tom Jericho, a brilliant British mathematician working as a member of the team struggling to crack the Nazi Enigma code. Jericho's own struggles include nerve-wracking mental labor, the mysterious disappearance of a former girlfriend, the suspicions of his co-workers within the paranoid high-security project, and the certainty that someone close to him, perhaps the missing girl, is a Nazi spy. The plot is pure fiction but the historical background, Alan Turing's famous wartime computing project that cracked the German U-boat communications code, is real and accurately portrayed. Enigma is convincingly plotted, forcefully written, and filled with well drawn characters; in short, it's everything a good technomystery should be."LITERATE AND SAVVY . . .

However, in spite of this trend towards cavalry, the pedes remained the backbone of the Roman army until well into the 5th century. This book details a warrior who was very different from the legionary who preceded him; perhaps he was not as well disciplined, but in many ways he was more flexible &#x2013; ready for deployment to trouble spots, and for fighting both as a skirmisher and a heavy infantryman.</p><p>Insights into the real lives of history&#39;s fighting men, packed with full colour illustrations, highly detailed cutaways, exploded artwork of weaponry and armour, and action-packed battle scenes.Simon MacDowall is a professional army officer with a life long passion for history.

Little Kelly needs expensive treatment for the post-traumatic stress that's turned her nearly catatonic, so Nick takes on a freelance assignment that gets him mixed up with Russian organized crime--in particular, with an enigmatic mob boss who has designs on some Finnish cybertechnology. When Nick realizes it's not industrial espionage that he's involved with but military secrets, he's caught between warring factions of the Russian Mafia and the Anglo-American alliance of intelligence agencies. The Westerners will do anything to keep the Echelon program out of the hands of Valentin Lebed--the Chechnyan Mafioso who makes Nick an offer he can't refuse--and the Maliskia, a gang of rival Russian criminals who want to derail Lebed's plans and take over Echelon themselves.<p> The action ranges from Helsinki to St. Petersburg to London, the weaponry is fully detailed, and the techniques of infiltration and retrieval carefully outlined; McNab, a former SAS commando who, according to the author's note "is still wanted by a number of terrorist organizations and is therefore forbidden to reveal his face or current location," obviously remembers every ache, pain, bruise, and injury he suffered in his life of derring-do, since they're all completely and graphically described here, too. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>The hair-raising follow-up to <i>Remote Control</i> and <i>Crisis Four</i> by former SAS member Andy McNab. <br> <br>If he hadn't needed the cash so badly, Nick Stone would never have messed with the Russian mafia. The job seemed simple enough for a man of his particular talents: kidnap a heartless, money-laundering mob boss from his fortified Helsinki hotel room and deliver him to St. Petersburg. But as the plan begins to unfold, Stone soon realizes that by no means has he been told the whole story. <br> <br>Catapulted into the bleak underworld of the former Soviet republic of Estonia, where unknown aggressors stalk the Arctic landscape, Stone finds that the mob may now turn out to be the least of his problems. Russia has embarked on a new Cold War offensive -- hacking into the West's computer systems and stealing their most coveted military secrets. As one bloody double-cross leads to another, Stone finds himself caught between the suicidal schemes of the British and American intelligence agencies and the ruthless Russians who want to silence him.</p><h2>A Picture Book of Thomas Jefferson (Picture Book Biography)</h2><p>A simple presentation of the third president&#39;s life from childhood.</p><p>David Abraham Adler (born April 10, 1947) is the author of nearly 200 books for children and young adults, most notably the Cam Jansen mystery series, the &#34;Picture Book of...&#34; series, and several acclaimed works about the Holocaust for young readers. Adler was born in New York City, New York. He graduated from Queens College in 1968 with a bachelor&#39;s degree in economics and education. For the next nine years, he worked as a mathematics teacher for the New York City Board of Education, while taking classes towards a master&#39;s degree in marketing, a degree he was awarded by New York University in 1971. In that same year, a question from his then-three-year-old nephew inspired Adler to write his first story, A Little at a Time, subsequently published by Random House in 1976. Adler&#39;s next project, a series of math books, drew on his experience as a math teacher. In 1977, he created his most famous character, Cam Jansen, originally featured in Cam Jansen and the Mystery of the Stolen Diamonds, which was published that year. Adler married psychologist Renee Hamada in 1973, and their first child, Michael, was born in 1977. By that time Adler had taken a break from teaching and, while his wife continued her work, he stayed home, took care of Michael, and began a full-time writing career. Adler has three children and one grandson. He lives in Woodmere, New York.Grade 1-3-- Adler makes Jefferson accessible to young children in this new addition to his biography series. In the brief text, he covers the main achievements and events in Jefferson's life and portrays him as an intellectual, inventor, lawyer, architect, and statesman who disliked presidential pomp. He mentions that, although opposed to the idea of slavery, Jefferson owned slaves throughout his life and several are depicted in the illustrations. Adler's writing is clear and objective, free of fictionalization, and easily read. It will also serve as a read-aloud. The format is attractive; each double-page spread contains a framed painting with short paragraphs superimposed on the illustration. The Wallners' charming watercolors include many details that show the furnishings, clothing, and daily life of 18th-century Virginia. Easier to read than Smith's Thomas Jefferson (Messner, 1989), the book is an informative introduction to this prominent American leader. --Jean H.

And if that's not enough to turn his life upside down, the reappearance of his first serious girlfriend is. The basketball star turned sports agent, who does a little detecting when business is slow, is saddened by the news that Emily Downing's 13-year-old son is dying and desperately needs a bone marrow transplant; even if she did leave him for the man who destroyed his basketball career, he wouldn't wish tsuris like that on anyone. And he's not at all interested in getting involved with Emily again, not even to track down the one mysterious donor who may be able to save the boy. But when Myron learns that Jeremy Downing is his <i>own</i> son, conceived the night before Emily and Greg Downing married, he embarks on a search for someone who disappeared a lifetime ago. And what he finds leads him to a powerful family determined to keep an old secret, a disgraced reporter who may have plagiarized a novel to create a serial killer, a very interested FBI agent, and a missing child. <p> This is the seventh outing in a series that's been gaining in popularity since Bolitar's first appearance, in Harlan Coben's <i>Deal Breaker</i>. Myron's a bit of a baby, but he's not afraid to get rough when the situation calls for it, he's eminently likable, and his heart's in the right place. The fireworks are supplied by his friend and partner, Win, who really deserves a series of his own, and Esperanza, the lesbian wrestler-lawyer who has finally talked Myron into making her a partner in the business. Like Coben's other Bolitar novels, she's worth every penny. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>6 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>A Gift for All Mankind: Learning the First Ten Lessons of a Course in Miracles</h2><p>Millions of readers have sought out A COURSE IN MIRACLES, a transcendent system of spirituality that goes beyond organized religion and modern tools such as psychotherapy.

A medieval document casts doubt on our pre-conceptions about a medieval folk hero and legend.<br><br>Who was Robin Hood? Romantic legend casts him as outlaw, archer, and hero of the people, living in Sherwood Forest with Friar Tuck, Little John and Maid Marian, stealing from the rich to give to the poor &#x2014; but there is no historical proof to back this up. The early ballads portray a quite different figure: impulsive, violent, vengeful, with no concern for the needy, no merry band, and no Maid Marian.<br><br><b>Hodd</b> provides a possible answer in the form of a medieval document rescued from a ruined church on the Somme. The testimony of the monk Matthew describes life with the half-crazed bandit Hodd in the greenwood.

Hodd and his crimes would have been forgotten without Matthew&#x2019;s minstrel skills, and it is the old monk&#x2019;s cruel fate to know that not only has he given himself up to apostasy and shame, but that his ballads were responsible for turning the murderous felon Robert Hodd into the most popular outlaw hero and folk legend of England, Robin Hood.<br><br>Written with his characteristic depth and subtlety, his sure understanding of folklore and precise command of detail, Adam Thorpe&#x2019;s ninth novel is both a thrilling re-examination of myth and a moving reminder of how human innocence and frailty fix and harden into history.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p>Adam Thorpe&#x2019;s first novel, <b>Ulverton</b>, was published in 1992.

The whole shebang is fabulously illustrated by Quentin Blake, Ralph Steadman, and a myriad of other fine artists.

But the revolutionaries were&#x2015;and saw themselves as&#x2015;heirs to a centuries-long struggle for just government and the rule of law, a struggle obstructed by local elites as well as the interventions of foreign powers. Elizabeth F. Thompson uncovers the deep roots of liberal constitutionalism in the Middle East through the remarkable stories of those who fought against poverty, tyranny, and foreign rule.</p><p>Fascinating, sometimes quixotic personalities come to light: Tanyus Shahin, the Lebanese blacksmith who founded a peasant republic in 1858; Halide Edib, the feminist novelist who played a prominent role in the 1908 Ottoman constitutional revolution; Ali Shariati, the history professor who helped ignite the 1979 Iranian Revolution; Wael Ghonim, the Google executive who rallied Egyptians to Tahrir Square in 2011, and many more. Their memoirs, speeches, and letters chart the complex lineage of political idealism, reform, and violence that informs today&#x2019;s Middle East.</p><p>Often depicted as inherently anti-democratic, Islam was integral to egalitarian movements that sought to correct imbalances of power and wealth wrought by the modern global economy&#x2015;and by global war. Motivated by a memory of betrayal at the hands of the Great Powers after World War I and in the Cold War, today&#x2019;s progressives assert a local tradition of liberal constitutionalism that has often been stifled but never extinguished.</p></p><p>Elizabeth F. Thompson is Associate Professor of History at the University of Virginia.&#x201c;A major work by an eminent scholar of the Middle East, <i>Justice Interrupted</i> provides a panoramic view of the region's struggle for justice and constitutional government over the past century and a half. <b>Thompson</b> offers powerful evidence that the pro-democratic aspirations of the Arab Spring have long roots.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Charles Kurzman, author of <i>The Missing Martyrs: Why There Are So Few Muslim Terrorists</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Once again, <b>Elizabeth Thompson</b> delivers a first-rate book: original in approach, rich in content, yet readable in style. Rejecting superficial cultural stereotypes, Thompson articulates the importance of the common citizen and the social activist struggling for a more just society during a time of wrenching change. She is inspiring and brilliant, and I will recommend her new book enthusiastically.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Leila Tarazi Fawaz, author of <i>An Occasion for War: Mount Lebanon and Damascus in 1860</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<b>Thompson</b> boldly tackles some of the thorniest issues in the making of the modern Middle East<i>--</i>constitutionalism, freedom, democracy, visions of justice from across the political spectrum<i>-</i>-and lucidly demonstrates how they have been experienced and contested by a broad range of social actors. An urgent and accessible history of 'ideas in action,' <i>Justice Interrupted </i>is essential reading for anyone interested in the past, present, and possible futures of the entire region.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Max Weiss, author of <i>In the Shadow of Sectarianism: Law, Shi'ism, and the Making of Modern Lebanon</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<b>Thompson</b> sees the thirst for justice and reform blossoming as long as 400 years ago, when the region was in the hands of the Ottoman Empire. In the generations since, bureaucrats, intellectuals, workers, and peasants have seized on the language of empire, law, and even Islam to agitate for rights and due process...Most intriguing, she finds elements of this constitutional liberalism even within fundamentalist Islamist movements that democratizers most worry about. These threads suggest a possible way forward, a way to build a constitutional, democratic consensus on indigenous if often overlooked traditions. Islamists and secular Arabs, it turns out, have found common ground in the past, even written constitutions together. The same could happen again now...It's easy to assume that religiously driven movements are all antidemocratic--and indeed, some have proven so in practice, like the ayatollahs in Iran or the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. But Thompson offers a more nuanced view, showing that many of these religious movements have internalized central elements of liberal discourse.<br>&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Thanassis Cambanis</b><b>, </b><b><i>Boston Globe</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[This] study on the rise of constitutionalism in the Middle East swiftly dispenses with the facile explanations of the Arab uprisings, instead offering readers a comprehensive yet nuanced look at the lasting impact of efforts to enshrine and institutionalize the language of justice across the region during the last two centuries.<br>&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Abdullah Al-Arian</b><b>, </b><b><i>H-Diplo</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<b>Thompson</b>&#x2019;s portraits are lively, accurate and informative--a highly readable primer for anyone seeking a deeper understanding of Middle Eastern political history.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Lawrence Rosen</b><b>, </b><b><i>Literary Review</i></b></p><h2>How to Write a KILLER LinkedIn Profile...

The copywork was low stress while yielding results, and we didn't dread it as we often have in the past. Each assignment was an integral part of the overall lesson and helped with a greater understanding of the material; even my ten-year-old didn't mind doing the work. Discussions were wonderful as I saw my children truly engaged in the stories, caring about the quality of material put into their notebooks, and looking forward to upcoming reading assignments. The art activities, particularly the grid map activities, were a huge hit and helped extend my son's desire for additional art assignments.

There have been no complaints about school with <i>Paths of Exploration</i>. They love the readings, enjoy the maps and activities, and clamor for the Nature Study. They even enjoy the copywork and dictation! And, they finally get regular art in each week.<br> *The living books chosen as the base for this curriculum are wonderful.

By bringing the age-old wisdom of biblical religion into active conversation with contemporary life and thought, the Pope "from a far country" has crafted a challenging proposal for the human future that is without parallel in the modern world. </p><p> Weigel explores new information about the Pope's role in some of the recent past's most stirring events, including the fall of communism; the Vatican/Israel negotiation of 1991-92; the collapse of the Philippine, Chilean, Nicaraguan, and Paraguayan dictatorships during the 1980s; and the epic papal visit to Cuba. Weigel also includes previously unpublished papal correspondence with Leonid Brezhnev, Mikhail Gorbachev, and Deng Xiaoping, and draws on hitherto unavailable autobiographical reminiscences by the Pope.</p><p> <em> Witness to Hope</em> also discusses the Pope's efforts to build bridges to other Christian communities, and to Judaism, Islam, and other great world religions; presents an analysis of John Paul's proposals for strengthening democratic societies in the twenty-first century; and offers synopses of every major teaching document in the pontificate. </p><p> Rounding out the dramatic story of Pope John Paul II are fresh translations of his poetry; detailed personal anecdotes of the Pope as a young man, priest, and friend, sketched by those who knew him best; and in-depth interviews with Catholic leaders throughout the world. </p><p> A magisterial biography of one of the most important figures--some might argue, the most important figure--of the twentieth century, <em>Witness to Hope</em> is an extraordinary testimony to the man and his accomplishments, and a papal biography unlike any other.</p></p><p><i>Witness To Hope: The Biography of Pope John Paul II</i> by George Weigel is as comprehensive a biography of its subject as can be hoped for while the Pope still lives. Weigel, a journalist who came to the Pope's attention after the publication of his book, <i>The Final Revolution: The Resistance Church and the Collapse of Communism</i>, wrote <i>Witness To Hope</i> with his subject's encouragement and assistance. Weigel had unprecedented access to the Pope's correspondence (with, among others, world leaders including Mikhail Gorbachev). He reports lengthy conversations with many members of the Pope's inner circle, and he occasionally reveals vivid details of the Pope's daily life (for example, at the beginning of each day, the Pope's adviser's hear moans and groaning from John Paul's solitary prayers in his private chapel). <p> According to Weigel, the Pope told him that other biographies "try to understand me from outside. But I can only be understood from inside." Unfortunately, Weigel's method for understanding the Pope "from inside" depends on psychological conjecture ("It may help to begin by thinking of Karol Wojtyla as a man who grew up very fast") and is weakened by his extreme eagerness to praise his subject ("the man with arguably the most coherent and comprehensive vision of the human possibility in the world ahead"). More troubling, Weigel does not ask some of the really difficult questions about this Pope--regarding his involvement with sects such as Opus Dei, for example, or the relationship between his innovative "theology of the body" and his conservative stance on homosexuality, or even the vicissitudes of prayer life. <i>Witness To Hope</i> is a valuable book because it reports many facts that others have not reported. But for incisive analysis of this Pope's theological and political significance, or for insight into his spiritual life, readers will have to wait until the principals in his life story are free to speak more frankly with some future biographer. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i></p><p>George Weigel is one of the world's foremost authorities on the Catholic Church and the author of the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller Witness to <em>Hope: The Biography of Pope John Paul II</em>. He is a Senior Fellow of the Ethics and Public Policy Center in Washington, D.C., and a consultant on Vatican affairs for NBC News.</p></p><h2>Advanced Muzzleloader&#39;s Guide</h2><p>The complete guide to muzzle loading rifles, pistols and shotguns, flintlock and percussion</p><p></p><h2>The Vimalakirti Sutra</h2><p>One of the most popular Asian classics for roughly two thousand years, the Vimalakirti Sutra stands out among the sacred texts of Mahayana Buddhism for its conciseness, its vivid and humorous episodes, its dramatic narratives, and its eloquent exposition of the key doctrine of emptiness or nondualism. Unlike most sutras, its central figure is not a Buddha but a wealthy townsman, who, in his mastery of doctrine and religious practice, epitomizes the ideal lay believer. For this reason, the sutra has held particular significance for men and women of the laity in Buddhist countries of Asia, assuring them that they can reach levels of spiritual attainment fully comparable to those accessible to monks and nuns of the monastic order. <br><br>Esteemed translator Burton Watson has rendered a beautiful English translation from the popular Chinese version produced in 406 C.E. by the Central Asian scholar-monk Kumarajiva, which is widely acknowledged to be the most felicitous of the various Chinese translations of the sutra (the Sanskrit original of which was lost long ago) and is the form in which it has had the greatest influence in China, Japan, and other countries of East Asia. Watson's illuminating introduction discusses the background of the sutra, its place in the development of Buddhist thought, and the profundities of its principal doctrine: emptiness.</p><p>Originally written in Sanskrit, this sutra is one of the most influential works in the Mahayana canon. This beautiful translation of Kumarajiva&#39;s popular Chinese version highlights the sutra&#39;s frequent touches of humor, the liveliness of its episodes, and its eloquent, orderly exposition of basic Mahayana tenets. Watson includes a brief history of early Buddhism and an introduction to the doctrine of non-dualism, a key tenet in Mahayana thought.The Vimalakirti Sutra, one of the most influential works of the Mahayana Buddhist canon, is of particular importance in the Ch&#39;an or Zen sect. Originally written in Sanskrit, probably in the first century c.e., it claims to record events more than four hundred years earlier. Noted for its eloquent, orderly exposition of the basic tenets of Mahayana, the text is also remarkable for the liveliness of its episodes and frequent touches of humor, rarities in a religious work of this type. The Vimalakirti Sutra is unusual in that its central figure is not a Buddha or Buddhas, but a wealthy townsman, Vimalakirti, who epitomizes the ideal lay believer. For this reason, and because of the sutra&#39;s enduring literary appeal, it has been particularly popular among lay Buddhists in China, Japan, and the other Asian countries where Mahayana doctrines prevail, and has exercised a marked influence on literature and art.</p><h2>Origami Master Class Flowers</h2><p><p>Origami Master Class: Flowers is an expert-level course in folding breathtakingly beautiful origami flowers. <i>Arranged</i> by designer, this book offers you step-by-step instructions to make 12 of the most complex flower models ever designed.

He lives in San Francisco, California.The second volume of Gonick's deeply researched, lucid and hilarious overview of history was published eight years ago. Good things take time, evidently. This third installment begins in the year 395, with the closing of Europe's pagan temples, and ends in 1492, with Columbus and crew setting sail. Readers get an overview of nearly everything that occurred between those two events, from the origins of Islam to the great Chinese dynasties and the Crusades, with "flashbacks" to the rise of African culture, the Turco-Mongol tribes and more. Gonick's take on history is whip-smart, skeptical about familiar but questionable stories and absolutely in command of dozens of simultaneous historical threads. He's also very funny, even at his most respectful. (In the chapter on the life of Muhammad, for instance, he makes a running joke of keeping the prophet permanently off-panel.) Gonick is fond of wacky little digressions, and the book includes plenty of learned slapstick (one ongoing gag concerns the "amazing amount of eye-gouging" in Byzantine history). The architecture and clothes in Gonick's work are drawn with convincing realism, but the people are broad, goofy caricatures, which somehow makes the entire presentation even friendlier: in fact, the author employs a handful of walk-ons disheveled, mustachioed academic types to explain the more complicated points.<br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Conceptual Development of Quantum Mechanics</h2><p>This book is a critical analysis, based on a broad physical, historical, and philosophical study, of how empirical phenomena led to the renunciation of classical physics and how experimental research -- combined with mathematical thought and philosophical speculation -- opened entirely novel perspective.

At his eponymous gallery on East Fifty-seventh Street, he showed several now legendary artists for the first time outside Europe. The collection paintings, sculpture, and drawings by Balthus, Bonnard, Chagall, Derain, Dubuffet, Giacometti, Magritte, Mir�, and the dealer&#x2019;s own father, Henri Matisse, among others was donated to The Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2004 by the foundation established by his widow.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These extraordinary artworks are presented with informative entries addressing the circumstances of each work&#x2019;s creation and the dealer&#x2019;s relationship to the artist. In the introduction, the story of Pierre Matisse&#x2019;s early struggles in New York is told for the first time and illustrated with previously unpublished archival photographs.</p></p><p><p>Sabine Rewald is Jacques and Natasha Gelman Curator and Magdalena Dabrowski is Special Consultant, both in the Department of Nineteenth-Century, Modern, and Contemporary Art at The Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p>"This book will interest anyone studying the history of collecting and collections in the 20th century."&#x2014;&nbsp;K.E.

The book was compiled as a contribution to lifesaving programs for African and American people; the proceeds from its sale will be administered by USA for Africa. The focus of each photographer is on innovative portraiture; the results are often breathtaking. Annie Leibovitz displays her usual virtuositythe most memorable picture being Whoopie Goldberg lying in a bathtub of milk, arms and legs waving in the air. Robert Mapplethorpe and Matthew Rolston use black and white to focus the viewer's eye on texture, movement, and expression. David Bailey's photographs were all taken backstage at the London Live Aid concert. Sheila Metzner's photographs are gorgeous, flowerlike compositions. Andy Warhol contributed some of the Sure Shot originals upon which his portraits are based. Snowden literally paints with his camera. Herb Ritts' use of light and shadow takes one's breath away. Greg Gorman captures with great artistry the ``moxie'' of his subjects.

A well-told tale." --BOOKLIST</p><h2>Why I Burned My Book and Other Essays on Disability (American Subjects)</h2><p>This wide-ranging book shows why Paul Longmore is one of the most respected figures in disability studies today. Understanding disability as a major variety of human experience, he urges us to establish it as a category of social, political, and historical analysis in much the same way that race, gender, and class already have been. The essays here search for the often hidden pattern of systemic prejudice and probe into the institutionalized discrimination that affects the one in five Americans with disabilities. Whether writing about the social critic Randolph Bourne, contemporary political activists, or media representations of people with disabilities, Longmore demonstrates that the search for heroes is a key part of the continuing struggle of disabled people to gain a voice and to shape their destinies. His essays on bioethics and public policy examine the conflict of agendas between disability rights activists and non-disabled policy makers, healthcare professionals, euthanasia advocates, and corporate medical bureaucracies. The title essay, which concludes the book, demonstrates the necessity of activism for any disabled person who wants access to the American dream.</p><p>&#34;Personal inclination made me a historian. Personal encounter with public policy made me an activist.&#34;Paul K. Longmore is Professor of History at San Francisco State University. He is the author of The Invention of George Washington and the co-editor (with Lauri Umansky) of The New Disability History: American Perspectives.</p><h2>Feeding the Ghosts</h2><p>Inspired by a true story, this suspenseful and deeply moving novel chronicles an incident of courage and rebellion that took place aboard a disease-riddled slave ship returning from Africa. It was called Zong, and when disease threatens to infect all aboard, the ship&#39;s captain orders his crew to seize the sick men, women, and children and throw them into the sea. But one female slave, Mintah, survives drowning and secretly climbs back onto the ship. From her hiding place, she attempts to rouse the remaining captives to rebel against the killings, becoming a dangerous force on the ship -- a force which is reckoned with in a shocking court case. Powerful and poetic, Feeding the Ghosts is an unforgettable testimony to the struggle against oblivion and a reminder about history overlooked and truth distorted.</p><p>The Zong was a real slave ship where slaves were tossed overboard due to disease in 1781. D&#39;Aguiar says, &#34;I came across an exhibit of a slave ship at The Maritime Museum in Liverpool.... A document at the gallery mentioned the Zong... one of the slaves who was thrown overboard managed to climb back on board. This contradicts the captain&#39;s claims that the slaves he threw away were too sick to survive the crossing.&#34; This incident, which provided inspiration for Feeding the Ghosts, also inspired a painting by J.M.W. Turner called &#34;The Slave Ship.&#34;Fred D&#39;Aguiar is an associate professor of English at the University of Miami.</p><h2>The Secrets of Wildflowers: A Delightful Feast of Little-Known Facts, Folklore, and History</h2><p>An authoritative and unique guide to an unsung treasure: North America's wildflowers.<br></p><p>Without wildflowers the world would be a pretty dull place.<br>Few things in nature beautify the world more than wildflowers. Their countless colors and endless designs are found almost anywhere the sun strikes the earth&#x2014;from fields to woods, deserts to ponds, and even in junkyards, dumps, and cracks in shopping-center parking lots.<br><i>The Secrets of Wildflowers</i>, Jack Sanders&#x2019;s colorful tribute, is bursting with odd facts and wonderful superstitions about some of North America&#x2019;s most beautiful and common plants. And this is just one of its many uses. You&#x2019;ll also find natural history, folklore, habitats, horticulture, ingenious uses past and present, origins of names, and even their literary pedigrees. Far richer and eminently more varied than any field guide, <i>The Secrets of Wildflowers</i> is one banquet no nature aficionado can pass up.<br>Wildflowers are more than just decorations. They are an essential part of our environment. They feed insects, birds, animals, and even humans. They hold together and condition the soil, they are the &#x201c;parents&#x201d; of our garden flowers, and they provide many modern medicines or the inspirations for them.<br>How they work and what they do are often overlooked, and how they have been used has largely been forgotten. <i>The Secrets of Wildflowers </i>provides a thorough introduction to more than one hundred representative species of North American wildflowers.<br>For more than 25 years, Jack Sanders has been one of North America&#x2019;s most ardent and colorful champions of wildflowers. His writing has for years elicited praise. &#x201c;One of the best things that has ever happened to wildflowers,&#x201d; wrote <i>Smithsonian</i> magazine of Sanders&#x2019;s <i>Hedgemaids and Fairy Candles</i>. Similar praise has come from the likes of the <i>New York Times</i>, the <i>Associated Press</i>, and <i>Wildflower</i>. &#x201c;He tells actual stories about rare and common plants and describes them in historical frameworks that make you want to run out and find them,&#x201d; wrote the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>.&nbsp;<i>The Secrets of Wildflowers</i> picks up where field guides leave off.

He addresses his early years&#x2014;shadowy times in postwar Paris that haunt his memory and have inspired his world-cherished body of fiction. In the spare, absorbing, and sometimes dreamlike prose that translator Mark Polizzotti captures unerringly, Modiano offers a memoir of his first twenty-one years. Termed one of his &#x201c;finest books&#x201d; by the <i>Guardian</i>, <i>Pedigree</i> is both a personal exploration and a luminous portrait of a world gone by. &nbsp;<br><br><i>Pedigree</i> sheds light on the childhood and adolescence that Modiano explores in <i>Suspended Sentences</i><i>,</i><i>Dora Bruder</i><i>,</i> and other novels. In this work he re-creates the louche, unstable, colorful world of his parents under the German Occupation; his childhood in a household of circus performers and gangsters; and his formative friendship with the writer Raymond Queneau. While acknowledging that memory is never assured, Modiano recalls with painful clarity the most haunting moments of his early life, such as the death of his ten-year-old brother. <i>Pedigree</i>, Modiano&#x2019;s only memoir, is a gift to his readers and a master key to the themes that have inspired his writing life.</p><p>A conversation with translator Mark Polizzotti <br> <br> <i>Pedigree</i>&nbsp;is a late work for Patrick Modiano that deals with his youth.&nbsp; What do we learn about him?&nbsp; <br> <br> Several things that I believe are essential to understanding Modiano&#x2019;s fictions. First, just how closely certain key recurring episodes in his novels are patterned on real events from his early life, and how profoundly they have shaped his sensibility. But also we learn about the context in which he grew up. For instance, certain areas of Paris&#x2014;the Bois de Boulogne, or particular streets in the 6th or 16th arrondissement&#x2014;show up frequently in his works; this memoir gives the backstory. More significantly, Modiano alludes in various novels to his problematic relations with his absentee mother and distant but controlling father; only after reading&nbsp; <i>Pedigree</i>&nbsp;did I truly grasp that complicated and heartbreaking dynamic. <br> &nbsp; <br> Winning the Nobel Prize in 2014 certainly changed the fortune of Modiano&#x2019;s literary career. How do you see his work in the tradition of Nobel laureates? <br> <br> One of the things that most appeals to me about Modiano&#x2019;s writing is its apparent modesty&#x2014;or rather, its ability to treat some of the great issues of the twentieth century, such as human responsibility in times of crisis or the vicissitudes of identity, without grandstanding or self-conscious profundity. Unlike many Nobel winners, his work does not proclaim its importance, but instead remains on a personal, human scale; the more universal significance of his writings is read, as it were, between the lines. This deceptively simple, &#x201c;local&#x201d; quality makes his work, to my mind, much more accessible and enjoyable to read than the works of many recent laureates&#x2014;but no less deserving of the honor.<b>Patrick Modiano</b>, winner of the 2014 Nobel Prize for literature and an internationally beloved novelist, lives in Paris, France. <b>Mark Polizzotti </b>has translated more than forty books from the French and is director of the publications program at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.</p><h2>Second Sight</h2><p>As U.S. agents around the world are kidnapped and injected with a super drug that drains them of vital secrets and leaves them with no memory of their ordeal, Paul Christopher sets out to stop the political mischief. Reprint.</p><p>Since his reemergence with the publication of Old Boys, Charles McCarry has been heralded as one of the select few novelists of espionage who manage to break out of his genre to shine as a brilliant and unique novelist. Second Sight is seventh in the series that follows the legendary spy Paul Christophera man ensnared by a line of work that never failed to exert its insidious influence outside professional boundaries. <p> Now retired and living the quiet life as a loving husband in Washington, D.C., Christopher has survived battlefields of World War II, undercover Cold War killing grounds, and imprisonment in China. But now, throughout the Arab world, U.S. agents are being kidnapped and brain-drained</p><p> by an unidentified enemy armed with a diabolical new drug. Christopher's old friend and superior in "the Outfit" calls with a command he feels he must obey. But what begins for Christopher as a global manhunt swiftly turns into something far closer to home. For the key to the danger he</p><p> must defuse is a secret buried deep in his own perilous past.</p>Charles McCarry is the author, most recently, of Christopher&#x2019;s Ghosts, and has written ten acclaimed novels featuring Paul Christopher and his family (all available from Overlook). During the Cold War, he was an intelligence officer operating under deep cover in Europe, Africa, and Asia.</p><h2>Jack and the Hungry Giant Eat Right With MyPlate</h2><p>Lucky for Jack, the giant he meets at the top of the beanstalk chasing him with a huge fork does not plan to eat him. He is more interested in nutrition than in devouring Jack. Using the USDA&#39;s MyPlate nutrition model, the giant makes Jack a scrumptious meal. As he cooks, he teaches Jack about the food groups--grains, proteins, fruits, vegetables, and dairy--and how much of each should be on Jack&#39;s plate. Jack also learns that he should get plenty of exercise, which he does as he climbs back down the beanstalk.</p><p>Loreen Leedy has written and illustrated more than thirty books for children. Her innovative books include Seeing Symmetry, which The Horn Book called &#34;excellent,&#34; and The Great Graph Contest, which School Library Journal called &#34;exciting and energetic&#34; in a starred review. She lives in Florida.K-Gr 3-This picture-book reworking of "Jack and the Beanstalk" begins with Jack's mother throwing the beans out the window and the adventurous boy climbing the resultant beanstalk and sneaking into the giant's castle. But instead of becoming the meal, Jack is treated to a lesson in healthy eating by Waldorf the giant, following the USDA guidelines. Each food group is reviewed, with options included that are often overlooked in traditional texts (quinoa and couscous among the grains, scallops and sardines among the proteins). The tale ends with Jack, the giant, and the giant's wife dining together and discussing possible exercises ("we could toss boulders," says the giant). Back matter has information about the MyPlate model, foods to avoid, links to activity pages, and the MyPlate government website. Ths is a great teaching tool; children will enjoy the twist on the familiar fairy tale; the clear, accessible information; and the colorful, cartoonlike digital illustrations.-Jasmine L.

Why do we visit our mistakes on our children? What makes life truly beautiful?Set in New England mainly and London partly, On Beauty concerns a pair of feuding families - the Belseys and the Kipps - and a clutch of doomed affairs. It puts low morals among high ideals and asks some searching questions about what life does to love. For the Belseys and the Kipps, the confusions - both personal and political - of our uncertain age are about to be brought close to home: right to the heart of family.&#39;The novel I didn&#39;t want to finish, I was enjoying it so much&#39; John Sutherland, Evening Standard&#39;Thrums with intellectual sass and know-how&#39; Literary Review&#39;Delightfully entertaining . . . filled with humour, generosity and contemporary sparkle&#39; Alex Clark, Daily Telegraph &#39;My novel of the year . . . Delicious&#39; Liz Jones, Evening Standard&#39;Satirical, wise and sexy&#39; Washington Post&#39;Heartstopping&#39; The Times Literary Supplement&#39;A triumph, Smith&#39;s comedy shines&#39; Daily Mail&#39;Ambitious, hugely impressive, beautifully observed&#39; Guardian</p><p>In an author's note at the end of <i>On Beauty</i>, Zadie Smith writes: "My largest structural debt should be obvious to any E.M. Forster fan; suffice it to say he gave me a classy old frame, which I covered with new material as best I could." If it is true that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, Forster, perched on a cloud somewhere, should be all puffed up with pride. His disciple has taken <i>Howards End</i>, that marvelous tale of class difference, and upped the ante by adding race, politics, and gender. The end result is a story for the 21st century, told with a perfect ear for everything: gangsta street talk; academic posturing, both British and American; down-home black Floridian straight talk; and sassy, profane kids, both black and white. <p> Howard Belsey is a middle-class white liberal Englishman teaching abroad at Wellington, a thinly disguised version of one of the Ivies. He is a Rembrandt scholar who can't finish his book and a recent adulterer whose marriage is now on the slippery slope to disaster. His wife, Kiki, a black Floridian, is a warm, generous, competent wife, mother, and medical worker. Their children are Jerome, disgusted by his father's behavior, Zora, Wellington sophomore firebrand feminist and Levi, eager to be taken for a "homey," complete with baggy pants, hoodies and the ever-present iPod. This family has no secrets--at least not for long. They talk about everything, appropriate to the occasion or not. And, there is plenty to talk about. </p><p> The other half of the story is that of the Kipps family: Monty, stiff, wealthy ultra-conservative vocal Christian and Rembrandt scholar, whose book has been published. His wife Carlene is always slightly out of focus, and that's the way she wants it. She wafts over all proceedings, never really connecting with anyone. That seems to be endemic in the Kipps household. Son Michael is a bit of a Monty clone and daughter Victoria is not at all what Daddy thinks she is. Indeed, Forster's advice, "Only connect," is lost on this group. </p><p> The two academics have long been rivals, detesting each other's politics and disagreeing about Rembrandt. They are thrown into further conflict when Jerome leaves Wellington to get away from the discovery of his father's affair, lands on the Kipps' doorstep, falls for Victoria and mistakes what he has going with her for love. Howard makes it worse by trying to fix it. Then, Kipps is granted a visiting professorship at Wellington and the whole family arrives in Massachusetts. </p><p> From this raw material, Smith has fashioned a superb book, her best to date. She has interwoven class, race, and gender and taken everyone prisoner. Her even-handed renditions of liberal and/or conservative mouthings are insightful, often hilarious, and damning to all. She has a great time exposing everyone's clay feet. This author is a young woman cynical beyond her years, and we are all richer for it. <i>--Valerie Ryan</i></p><b>Praise for <i>On Beauty</i>:</b> <br><br> "A thoroughly original tale . . . wonderfully engaging, wonderfully observed . . .

"'If you don't behave,' my father said, 'I'm gonna pull over right here, and you can wait by the side of the road till we come and get you.'" Little brother Rudy decides to cooperate, while older brother Richard chooses to wait by the side of the road: "An hour later I was kind of used to it. Two hours later it was where I wanted to live." Three hours later, his family comes back for him, but he's not ready to go. He's not ready the next time, either, but does accept a hamburger. And a sweater. Eventually, he is living full-time by the side of the road, aided by mother and father only occasionally dropping by with a poncho or a snowsuit, or a house, tutor, and generator, depending upon the season. Richard's elaborate tunnel system for storing "secret stuff" from comic books to "bottles thrown out of car windows" is straight out of every child's wildest dreams, as is his mock-Thoreau-style existence, free from grumpy dad and family rules (but well stocked with computer games and other essentials).<p> Throughout this outlandish scenario (Richard grows up and has his own family, still by the side of the road, later to be joined by his elderly parents), we think about discipline ("The way he said it made me unlearn the lesson I was right then in the middle of learning"), about family ("Sometimes you have to make concessions"), about independence, about dependence ("I'm hungry and I'm cold"), about loneliness, and about self-sufficiency. Feiffer's expressive, fluid drawings capture every motion and emotion with just the right lines, making this crazy run-on picture book a rousing success. (Ages 7 and older) <i>--Karin Snelson</i></p>Gr. 2-4, younger for reading aloud. Like William Steig's masterful <i>Grown-Ups Get to Do All the Driving</i> (1995), this picture book about family power starts in the car. The kid is furious because "they stick you in the backseat," and when his father threatens to abandon him ("either you behave or you get out of this car"), the boy acts cool ("who likes to be pushed around?"), calls his dad's bluff, and chooses to live by the side of the road. Forever. At first he's scared, but the triumph over his monster dad is worth it. This is every seething child's fantasy, especially when the rebellion fuses into a survival adventure with the child making a home for himself where he can do just what he likes, with a sleeping bag, a TV, a computer, and lots more. But, just like a kid's game, the story doesn't know how to end. It goes on far too long with details about the boy's growing up, building a tunnel home, getting married, having kids, and allowing his parents to move in with his family, to live happily ever after. Feiffer's full-page, black-and-white pictures don't need all that padding. A few relaxed lines against a blurry background, the minimalist images speak volumes. Whatever the boy may be saying, his intense body language reveals his terror, guilt, jealousy, anger, and pride--and all of them mixed together. And always, the straight, black, paved road is there with its shining white markings, as demonic as the father's authority. In one sense, the story is an adult's hippie dream, but the adult meanderings really only dilute what would have been a strong children's story. <i>Hazel Rochman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

That alone makes them special in baseball history, but as Maury Klein relates in <i>Stealing Games</i> they also embodied a rapidly changing America on the cusp of a faster, more frenetic pace of life dominated by machines, technology, and urban culture.</p><p>Baseball, too, was evolving from the dead-ball to the live-ball era--the cork-centered ball was introduced in 1910 and structurally changed not only the outcome of individual games but the way the game itself was played, requiring upgraded equipment, new rules, and new ways of adjudicating. Changing performance also changed the relationship between management and players. The Giants had two stars--the brilliant manager John McGraw and aging pitcher Christy Mathewson--and memorable characters such as Rube Marquard and Fred Snodgrass; yet their speed and tenacity led to three pennants in a row starting in 1911. <i>Stealing Games </i>gives a great team its due and underscores once more the rich connection between sports and culture.</p></p><p><b>Maury Klein</b> is renowned as one of the finest historians of American business and economy. He is the author of many books, including <i>A Call to Arms: Mobilizing America for World War II</i>; <i>The Power Makers: Steam, Electricity, and the Men Who Invented Modern America</i>; and <i>Rainbow's End: The Crash of 1929</i>. He is Professor Emeritus of History at the University of Rhode Island. Klein lives in Saunderstown, Rhode Island.<p>"Mr. Klein&#x2019;s broad historical knowledge is at play here as he often moves outside the lines to talk about the culture, economics and even the disasters of the time . . . [his] achievement is to let us view early-20th-century America through the prism of baseball." &#x2015;<i>Wall Street Journal</i></p><p>"[A] thorough account of the 1911 New York Giants . . . [Klein] recounts the Giants&#x2019; evolution into a dynasty that went on to win three straight pennants, beginning in 1911. Klein writes for the serious baseball fan, and . . . offers thought-provoking details of the drastic changes baseball underwent at the time, both on the field and in the boardrooms." &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>"Veteran nonfiction author Klein uses his familiarity with the early twentieth century to contextualize this account of legendary baseball manager John McGraw and his 1911 New York Giants. It is fortunate that, while a baseball expert, Klein is primarily a business historian and, thus, is able to neatly fit the sport into the cultural history of the times--Progressivism, the automobile, the airplane, and so on . . . A well-written and absorbing account of an often-overlooked baseball season." &#x2015;Mark Levine, <i>Booklist</i></p><p>"A robust portrait of what the sport was like during the dead-bill era." &#x2015;<i>BookPage</i></p><p>"Populated by memorable and brilliant characters . . . [<i>Stealing Games</i>] gives a great--yet overlooked--team and season their due." &#x2015;<i>Examiner.com, "A Look as Some of This Year's Most Notable Books"</i></p><p>"Maury Klein has created a heavily researched and beautifully written book that skillfully blends a wealth of statistics with the human side of the story as he articulates the tale of the 1911 New York Giants. <i>Stealing Games</i> is a must read for every serious baseball fan." &#x2015;<i>RunSpotRun.com</i></p><p>&#x201c;Klein's book reads like a fairy tale . . .

Laughing hysterically.</p> <p>I was lying there, covered-drenched-in spilled melted chocolate and I couldn't stop giggling. There were other faces now, looking down on me; some I was sure I even recognized. They weren't laughing. They all looked very serious in fact. This somehow struck me as even funnier and set me off again.</p> <p>From the periphery, I heard someone say, "Pick them up!" and someone else say, "No way! You pick them up! Gross!" And then I heard someone else, who I thought was Flynn, the new stock boy, say, "I'll dial 911," and someone else say, "Flynn, don't be stupid; it's 999. You're not American," and someone else say, "I think you can dial 911 now because there were so many idiots who kept dialing it." And someone else taking out their phone and saying something about needing an ambulance, which I thought was hilarious as well, and then someone, who was definitely Del, our old grumpy janitor, saying, "Well, they're probably going to want to throw this batch away then." And the idea that they might not throw away the enormous vat of chocolate but try to sell it instead when it had landed all over me actually was funny.</p> <p>After that, thank God, I don't remember anything, although later, in the hospital, an ambulance man came over and said I was a total bloody nutter in the ambulance and that he'd always been told that shock affected people in different ways, but mine was just about the differentest he'd ever seen. Then he saw my face and said, "Cheer up, love; you'll laugh again." But at that point I wasn't exactly sure I ever would.</p> <p>- - -</p> <p>"Oh come off it, Debs, love, it's only her foot. It could have been a lot worse. What if it had been her nose?"</p> <p>That was my dad, talking to my mum. He liked to look on the bright side.</p> <p>"Well, they could have given her a new nose. She hates her nose anyway."</p> <p>That was definitely my mum. She's not quite as good as my dad at looking on the bright side. In fact, I could hear her sobbing. But somehow, my body shied away from the light; I couldn't open my eyes. I didn't think it was a light; it felt like the sun or something. Maybe I was on holiday. I couldn't be at home-the sun never bloody shines in Kidinsborough, my hometown, voted worst town in England three years in a row before local political pressure got the show taken off the air.</p> <p>My parents zoned out of earshot, just drifted off like someone tuning a radio. I had no idea if they were there or if they ever had been. I knew I wasn't moving, but inside I felt as though I was squirming and wriggling and trapped inside a body-shaped prison someone had buried me in. I could shout, but no one could hear me. I tried to move, but it wasn't working. The dazzle would turn to black and back again to the sun, and none of it made the faintest bit of sense to me as I dreamt-or lived-great big nightmares about toes and feet and parents who spontaneously disappear and whether this was going crazy and whether I'd actually dreamt my whole other life, the bit about being me, Anna Trent, thirty years old, taster in a chocolate factory.</p> <p>Yes, actually. While we're at it, here are my top ten "Taster in a Chocolate Factory" jokes that I get at Faces, our local nightclub. It's not a very nice nightclub, but the rest are really much, much worse:</p> <p>1. Yes, I will give you some free samples.</p> <p>2. No, I'm not as fat as you clearly expected me to be.</p> <p>3. Yes, it is exactly like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.</p> <p>4. No, no one has ever done a poo in the chocolate vat. (Though I wouldn't necessarily have put it past Flynn.)</p> <p>5. No, it actually doesn't make me more popular than a normal person, as I am thirty, not seven.</p> <p>6. No, I don't feel sick when confronted with chocolate; I absolutely adore it. But if it makes you feel better about your job to think that I am, feel free.</p> <p>7. Oh, that is so interesting that you have something even tastier than chocolate in your underpants, yawn. (N.B.: I would like to be brave enough to say that, but I'm not that brave really. I normally just grimace and look at something else for a while. My best mate Cath soon takes care of them anyway. Or, occasionally, dates them.)</p> <p>8. Yes, I will suggest your peanut/beer/vodka/jam-flavored chocolate idea, but I doubt we'll be as rich as you think.</p> <p>9. Yes, I can make actual real chocolate, although at Braders Family Chocolates, they're all processed automatically in a huge vat and I'm more of a supervisor really. I wish I did more complex work, but according to the bosses, nobody wants their chocolates messed about with; they want them tasting exactly the same and lasting a long time. So it's quite a synthetic process.</p> <p>10. No, it's not the best job in the world. But it's mine and I like it. Or at least I did, until I ended up in here.</p> <p>Then I normally say, "Rum and coke, thanks for asking."</p> <p>"Anna."</p> <p>A man was sitting on the end of my bed. I couldn't focus on him. He knew my name but I didn't know his. That seemed unfair.</p> <p>I tried to open my mouth. It was full of sand. Someone had put sand in my mouth. Why would anyone do that?</p> <p>"Anna."</p> <p>The voice came again. It was definitely real, and it was definitely connected to the shadow at the end of my bed.</p> <p>"Can you hear me?"</p> <p>Well, of course I can hear you. You're sitting on the end of my bed shouting at me was what I wanted to say, but all that came out was a kind of dry croak.</p> <p>"That's great, that's great, very good. Would you like a drink of water?"</p> <p>I nodded. It seemed easiest.</p> <p>"Good, good. Don't nod too much; you'll dislodge the wires. NURSE!"</p> <p>I don't know whether the nurse came or not, because I was suddenly gone again. My last conscious thought was that I hoped she or he didn't mind being yelled at by people who sat on other people's beds. And I couldn't remember: had my parents said something was wrong with my nose?</p> <p>- - -</p> <p>"Here she is."</p> <p>It was the same voice, but how much later I couldn't tell. The light seemed different. A sudden shock of pain traveled through me like a lightning bolt and I gasped.</p> <p>"There you go; she's going to be great."</p> <p>Dad.</p> <p>"Oh, I don't like the look of this."</p> <p>Mum.</p> <p>"Uhm...can I have that water?" I asked, but it came out like "Ca ha wa?"</p> <p>Thankfully someone spoke desert sand, because instantly a plastic cup was put to my lips. That small cup of tepid chalky tap water was the single best thing I had ever put in my mouth in my entire life, and that includes the first time I tasted a cr�me egg.</p> <p>I slurped it down and asked for another, but someone said no, and that was that. Maybe I was in prison.</p> <p>"Can you open your eyes for us?" came the commanding voice.</p> <p>"Course she can."</p> <p>"Oh, Pete, I don't know. I just don't know."</p> <p>Oddly, it was slightly to spite my mother's lack of ambition for me in the eye-opening department that really made me try. I flickered and suddenly hazing into view was the shape sitting on the end of my bed I'd been aware of before-I wished he'd stop that-and two shapes as familiar as my own hands.</p> <p>I could make out my mother's reddish hair that she colored at home, even though my best mate Cath had offered to do it down at the salon for a price that she thought was next to nothing, but my mother thought that was extravagant and that Cath was loose (that last bit was true, though that had nothing to do with how good she was at hair, which admittedly also wasn't very), so about one week a month my mum had this kind of odd, henna-like fringe around the top of her forehead where she hadn't wiped it off properly. And my dad was in his best shirt, which really made me worry. He didn't dress like that for anything but weddings and funerals, and I was pretty much 100 percent sure I wasn't getting married, unless Darr had suddenly regenerated into a completely different physical and personality type, and I figured that unlikely.</p> <p>"Hello?" I said, feeling a rush that somewhere, the desert sands were retreating, that the division between what was real and what was a writhing sandy ball of confusion and pain was retreating, that Anna was back, that the skin I was wearing was mine after all.</p> <p>"Darling!"</p> <p>My mum burst into tears. My dad, not prone to huge outbursts of affection, gently squeezed my hand-the hand, I noticed, that didn't have a big tube going into it, right under the skin. My other hand did. It was the grossest thing I'd ever seen in my life.</p> <p>"Ugh, gah," I said. "What's this? It's disgusting."</p> <p>The figure at the end of my bed smiled in a rather patronizing way.</p> <p>"I think you'd find things a lot more disgusting if it wasn't there," he said. "It's giving you painkillers and medication."</p> <p>"Well, can I have some more?" I said. The lightning-sharp pain flashed through me again, from the toes of my left foot upward right through my body.</p> <p>I suddenly became aware of other tubes on me, some going in and out of places I didn't really want to discuss in front of my dad. I went quiet. I felt really, really weird.</p> <p>"Is your head spinning?" said the bed-sitter. "That's quite normal."</p> <p>My mum was still sniffing.</p> <p>"It's all right, mum."</p> <p>What she said next chilled me to the bone.</p> <p>"It's not all right, love. It's not all right at all."</p> <p>- - -</p> <p>Over the next few days, I seemed to fall asleep on and off and at completely random moments. Dr. Ed-yes, really, that's how he referred to himself-was my named specialist. Yeah, all right, I know he was a doctor and everything, tra la la, but you can be Ed or you can be, like, Dr. Smith or something. Anything else is just showing off, like you're a doctor on telly or something.</p> <p>I think Dr. Ed would have LOVED to have been a doctor on the telly, looking at people who've got two bumholes and things. He was always very smartly turned out and did things like sit on the end of the bed, which other doctors didn't do, and look at you in the eye, like he was making a huge effort to be with you as a person. I think I preferred the snotty consultant who came around once a week, barely looked at me, and asked his medical students embarrassing questions.</p> <p>Anyway, Dr. Ed shouldn't have been so chummy because it was kind of his fault that I was even there. I had slipped at the factory-everyone had gotten very excited wondering if there was some health and safety rule that hadn't been followed and we were all about to become millionaires, but actually as it turned out it was completely my fault. It was an unusually warm spring day and I'd decided to try out my new shoes, which turned out to be hilariously inappropriate for the factory floor, and I'd skidded and, in a total freak, hit a vat ladder and upended the entire thing. Then I'd come into the hospital and gotten sick.</p> <p>"A bug tried to eat me?" I asked Dr. Ed.</p> <p>"Well, yes, that's about right," he said, smiling to show overtly white teeth that he must have gotten whitened somewhere. Maybe he just liked to practice for going on television. "Not a big bug, Anna, like a spider."</p> <p>"Spiders aren't bugs," I said crossly.</p> <p>"Ha! No." He flicked his hair. "Well, these things are very, very tiny, so small you couldn't see a thousand of them even if they were sitting right here on my finger!!"</p> <p>Perhaps there was something misprinted on my medical notes that said instead of being nearly thirty-one, I was in fact eight.</p> <p>"I don't care what size they are," I said. "They make me feel like total crap."</p> <p>"And that's why we're fighting them with every weapon we have!" said Dr. Ed, like he was Spider-Man or something. I didn't mention that if everyone had cleaned up with every mop they had, I probably wouldn't have caught it in the first place.</p> <p>And anyway, oh Lord, I just felt so rough. I didn't feel like eating or drinking anything but water. (Dad brought me some marshmallows and Mum practically whacked him because she was 100 percent certain they'd get trapped in my throat and I'd totally die right there in front of him.) I slept a lot, and when I wasn't sleeping, I didn't feel well enough to watch the telly or read or speak to people on the phone or anything. I had a lot of messages on Facebook, according to my phone, which someone-Cath, I was guessing-had plugged in beside my bed, but I wasn't really fussed to read any of them.</p> <p>I felt different, as if I'd woken up foreign, or in a strange land where nobody spoke my language-not Mum, not Dad, not my friends. They didn't speak the language of strange hazy days where nothing made much sense, or constant aching, or the idea of moving being too difficult to contemplate, even moving an arm across a bed. The country of the sick seemed a very different place, where you were fed and moved and everyone spoke to you like a child and you were always, always hot.</p> <p>- - -</p> <p>I dozed off again and heard a noise. Something familiar, I was sure of it, but I couldn't tell from when. I was at school. School figured a lot in my fever dreams. I had hated it. Mum had always said she wasn't academic so I wouldn't be either, and that had pretty much sealed the deal, which in retrospect seems absolutely stupid. So for ages when I hallucinated my old teachers' faces in front of me, I didn't take it too seriously. Then one day I woke up very early, when the hospital was still cool and as quiet as it ever got, which wasn't very, and I turned my head carefully to the side, and there, just in the next bed, not a dream or a hallucination, was Mrs. Shawcourt, my old French teacher, gazing at me calmly.</p> <p>I blinked in case she would go away. She didn't.</p> <p>It was a small four-bed side ward I'd been put on, a few days or a couple of weeks earlier-it was hard to tell precisely-which seemed a bit strange; either I was infectious or I wasn't, surely. The other two beds were empty and over the days to come had a fairly speedy turnover of extremely old ladies who didn't seem to do much but cry.</p> <p>"Hello," she said. "I know you, don't I?"</p> <p>I suddenly felt a flush, like I hadn't done my homework.</p> <p>I had never done my homework. Me and Cath used to bunk off-French, it was totally useless, who could possibly need that?-and go sit around the back field where the teachers couldn't see you and speak with fake Mancunian accents about how crap Kidinsborough was and how we were going to leave the first chance we got.</p> <p>"Anna Trent."</p> <p>I nodded.</p> <p>"I had you for two years."</p> <p>I peered at her more closely. She'd always stood out in the school; she was by far the best dressed teacher, since most of them were a right bunch of slobs. She used to wear these really nicely fitted dresses that made her look a bit different. You could tell she hadn't gotten them down at Matalan. She'd had blond hair then...</p> <p>I realized with a bit of a shock that now she didn't have any hair at all. She was very thin, but then she always had been thin, but now she was really, really thin.</p> <p>I said the stupidest thing I could think of-in my defense, I ...</p></p><h2>Lowland Rider</h2><p>Unhinged by the brutal murder of his wife and child, Jamie Gordon goes underground into the New York City subway where he discovers, and must ultimately confront, an ancient and evil force</p><p></p><h2>The Soldier&#39;s Wife: A Novel</h2><p><b>The &#x201c;brilliant, mesmerizing storyteller&#x201d; (<i>The Washington Post</i>) Joanna Trollope illuminates an experience shared by millions of people:&nbsp; a soldier&#x2019;s return to family life causes three generations of a family to struggle with the impact of war on their relationships.</b><br><br><b>WHAT HAPPENS WHEN LOVE AND DUTY COLLIDE?</b> <br><br><b>DAN RILEY IS A MAJOR IN THE BRITISH ARMY. </b>After a six-month tour of duty in Afghanistan, he is coming home to the wife and young daughters he adores.

At school&#x2014;best, really, not to think about school if she could help it&#x2014;she had devised this method of taking charge of herself deliberately and methodically, as a way of dealing with homesickness. Wake before everyone else, go through the wretched mental photo gallery of home and Mum and the twins and the dog, and the smells museum of the kitchen and Mum&#x2019;s sweater drawer and the awkward cupboard where the bed linen lived, whose door would never shut, then gulp, sniff, wipe eyes, sit up, and breathe. Breathe and breathe. Eyes shut, then eyes open. Swallow. Find hairbrush and begin to brush, reminding herself how amazingly lucky she was to have long, thick, straight hair and not the curly or frizzy kind that got you despised for something that you couldn&#x2019;t possibly be blamed for in the first place. Put hairbrush back. One more deep breath. Up.<br> <br>Isabel put her fingers lightly across her eyelids, and opened her eyes slowly behind them. She was not, of course, at school. She was at home, in her own bedroom, at number seven, the Quadrant, Larkford Camp, Wiltshire, which had been home now for nearly two years. Before that home had been a bit in Germany, and a bit in Yorkshire and a bit in London, and before that, when it was just Mum and Isabel on their own, a bit in another part of London in a high-up flat with the top of a tree right outside the windows, which Isabel believed she remembered with a passionate nostalgia. There&#x2019;d also been schools to go with all these places, school after school.<br> <br>&#x201c;Five schools by year six,&#x201d; Mum had said to Isabel, trying to make the case for boarding school. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s too much. It&#x2019;s too much for you. It isn&#x2019;t fair. You make friends and then you move and lose them. Don&#x2019;t you think you&#x2019;d rather have continuity, even if it means sleeping away from home?&#x201d;<br> <br>Isabel didn&#x2019;t know. Even now, technically settled into boarding school, she didn&#x2019;t know. She wanted to feel steadier, she wanted to please, she understood that if Dan got a promotion they might move again&#x2014;but then, if he didn&#x2019;t, if they didn&#x2019;t, why was it necessary for her to be away from home when home wasn&#x2019;t, after all, changing? And then there were the twins. The twins went to a local nursery school, and when they were five would go to the local primary.<br> <br>&#x201c;But the twins&#x2014;&#x201d; Isabel began.<br> <br>Mum looked at her. Isabel could see she understood and hadn&#x2019;t got a real answer. She just said, &#x201c;We&#x2014;can&#x2019;t plan, you see. Not if we want to stay together. As a family. But if you go to boarding school, at least you know&#x2014;I know&#x2014;that one thing, at least, will go on as before. That&#x2019;s all.&#x201d;<br> <br>In Isabel&#x2019;s experience, it was only the small things that went on as before, like the smell of the linen cupboard and the twins&#x2019; refusal to eat anything orange and the way one fingernail on her left hand grew at a very slight angle. The big stuff, like what was going to happen next, to all of them, was always a giant question mark hanging in the air, affecting everything, every mood. And even when the question mark was answered, it was always replaced by another one. Like today. Today was a big day, a day they had been looking forward to for six months, a day that was circled on the kitchen calendar, and for which the twins had made a huge messy paper banner randomly stuck with patches of shiny colored paper and scraps of pink feather from a dressing-up boa.<br> <br>Today, Dan was coming home from Afghanistan, with his whole battery. That, Isabel knew, meant about a hundred soldiers. Plus Dan. Plus all the other soldiers, from the other batteries, from the regiment. Planes and planes of them, all coming home together, in transports like flying sardine cans, Dan said, only huge. So Dan&#x2019;s coming home took away the question mark of would he be killed or wounded while he was away, which was a huge relief because Dan had always been kind to Isabel, and she appreciated that. But now there was another question mark in place of the would-Dan-be-killed one, and that, although not as awful, was still a deep anxiety.<br> <br>Isabel took her hands away from her face and stared hard at the ceiling above her. People at school talked about what might happen to their soldier fathers a lot. Nobody was supposed to look at or listen to the news at school, but people did, all the same, and then whispered about it. There&#x2019;d been a helicopter crash in Afghanistan last term, and the radio announcer had said, &#x201c;All killed. The relatives have been informed,&#x201d; and Libby Guthrie, whose father was in the Army Flying Corps and who had gone quite white, said, &#x201c;Oh, phew. Relatives have been told. So we&#x2019;re OK, then.&#x201d; They&#x2019;d all screamed then, and got hysterical with relief, jumping about with their arms round each other, and Isabel had felt an intense, brief, heady sensation of belonging.<br> <br>But she didn&#x2019;t feel that now. She felt very separate and very apprehensive. Dan was coming home and Mum would be thrilled and the twins would be thrilled, and she would be pleased. But what, the new question mark asked, would he be <i>like</i>?<br> <br>In the kitchen, Alexa had the fridge door open. The interior was immaculate, the contents arranged with precision and by category. The kitchen floor&#x2014;Army-issue vinyl printed to resemble outdated Italian floor tiles&#x2014;shone. So did the windows. The walls, which she had painted pale blue herself, although she knew she would have to return them to magnolia when they left the quarter, were smear-free except for the twins&#x2019; exuberant Welcome Home Daddy poster. There were flowers on the table, the tea towels were ironed, and her hair, still damp from the shower, had possibly never been cleaner. Her friend Mo had been round the evening before on her way to an Army Benevolent Fund early Christmas fair&#x2014;&#x201c;Twenty quid for tepid curry with the Old and Bold&#x2014;you&#x2019;re so lucky you can&#x2019;t get a babysitter and come with me&#x201d;&#x2014;and had shouted with laughter at the flawless state of the house.<br> <br>&#x201c;God, we&#x2019;re pathetic. What do we think we&#x2019;re doing? Last time Baz got back from exercise he was completely, utterly filthy, and as rank as a polecat, and there I was, spotless in every crevice, not a hair on my body. I <i>ask</i> you!&#x201d;<br> <br>Alexa said, surveying her manicured hands&#x2014;no varnish, but no torn cuticles, either&#x2014;&#x201c;I suppose it&#x2019;s relief. And excitement. And&#x2014;&#x201d; She stopped.<br> <br>&#x201c;And what?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Army habit. Keeping up appearances. Smart at all times.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mo gave herself a quick glance in Alexa&#x2019;s hall mirror. She pulled down the hem of her embroidered sweater. &#x201c;I should be wearing a dress. To satisfy the Old and Bold. They&#x2019;ll be in Jaeger and regimental brooches, <i>comme toujours</i>.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You look great,&#x201d; Alexa said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Better on a horse, though. It disguises my low center of gravity.&#x201d; She leaned forward and gave Alexa a quick kiss. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be thinking of you tomorrow. It&#x2019;ll be weird but wonderful. Have a row to clear the air as soon as you can&#x2014;it&#x2019;ll get him out of his cave. We usually schedule it for day four.&#x201d;<br> <br>Alexa picked a booklet out of a tidy pile on the hall table, and held it out. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what Welfare recommend, only more circumspectly.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What on earth&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Homecoming,&#x201d; Alexa said. &#x201c;Welfare briefing on how to manage men going away and then men coming back again.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mo didn&#x2019;t try to take it. &#x201c;What a hoot.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;None of it&#x2019;s a hoot.&#x201d;<br> <br>There was a small pause, and then Mo opened the front door. She blew Alexa a second kiss. &#x201c;But we have to get on with it, don&#x2019;t we? The house looks a peach and so do you. Lucky Major Riley.&#x201d;<br> <br>The door had slammed behind her, and Alexa heard the second slam of her car door, and then the car reversing and roaring away as if she were late to catch a train. Dan said Mo was at her happiest in an emergency, and Alexa had opened her mouth to say that maybe the visible and urgent expenditure of energy was more like a coping mechanism, and had then, for no reason she was very proud of, shut it again. Dan admired people who coped in emergencies. Emergencies were, after all, what he was trained for. And that was just one of the many things she had had to learn.<br> <br>Something else she had learned now lay before her in the fridge. The food for a man sated with nourishment in foil pouches. Simple proteins&#x2014;steak, chicken&#x2014;beers, fruit and vegetables, powerfully mature Cheddar. He would probably eat nothing for a day or two&#x2014;although the beers would vanish and no doubt much of the bottle of supermarket whisky she had bought&#x2014;and then he would eat ravenously, whatever straightforward, un-messed-about food she put in front of him, liberally doused in Tabasco sauce. The British Army, she sometimes thought, could absorb as much Tabasco sauce as Avery Island, Louisiana, could produce. The twins played shops with the rinsed-out miniature Tabasco bottles provided in every twenty-four-hour Army ration pack&#x2014;dozens of them, perfect replicas of the originals down to the McIlhenny label. Alexa pictured soldierly insides glowing and fire-hardened from years of pepper sauce which reduced everything, in her view, to a blazing similarity. Which was, perhaps, what soldiers wanted&#x2014;a hot, peppery mush you could shovel in straight from the microwave or a pan of hot water. Certainly, if you shopped in the little supermarket which served the blocks behind the wire where over three thousand single soldiers lived, the freshest item you&#x2019;d find there would be a foot-long sausage roll&#x2014;no preparation, no unfamiliarity, no need for cutlery.<br> <br>The fridge let out a bleat of alarm at being left open so long. Alexa gave a little start and banged it shut. What was she doing, standing gazing at marshaled rows of yogurt pots with wet hair and none of the children either dressed or breakfasted? She was doing, she supposed, what her mother had done before every diplomatic party, checking and rechecking, feeling faintly sick and distinctly choked with anxious expectation, and possessed by a simultaneous conviction that she could not cope with what lay ahead and nor could she cope with it not happening.<br> <br>She crossed to the window and held on to the edge of the sink below it. Rough autumn grass&#x2014;she had mown it, she hoped for the last time that year, three weeks ago&#x2014;stretched from the front of the house to the ragged hedge which separated them, and the house they were attached to, from the narrow asphalted road that ran round the Quadrant. There was a big circle of grass in the middle of the Quadrant, and a clump of beech trees through which the unmistakable figure of the Brigadier&#x2019;s wife&#x2014;small, upright, and purposeful&#x2014;was making her way with two liver-and-white spaniels at her heels. She was the only officer&#x2019;s wife in the regiment, Alexa thought, not to have Labradors&#x2014;black Labradors&#x2014;but she had grown up with spaniels, she said, she understood them. She also had cats.<br> <br>&#x201c;Pansy animals, possibly,&#x201d; she once said to Alexa. &#x201c;But bright. I like a clever creature.&#x201d;<br> <br>Alexa turned her head. Behind her, keeping a watchful eye but not moving until instructed, was Dan&#x2019;s black Labrador, Beetle. He was not a clever creature, but he was biddable, kind, and reliable. He was also the first dog Alexa had ever lived with, having had a wandering diplomatic upbringing that never seemed to allow for more pets than a tank, once, of tiny turtles, which had proved, after the initial wonder at their size and perfection, to be no more interesting to own than a box of slightly animated stones. Beetle was the first living thing Dan had introduced to Alexa&#x2014;before any friend, before his father&#x2014;and he had also proved to be the route that Isabel could take to accepting that Dan was here to stay in their lives, in a role she only really associated with a photograph.<br> <br>&#x201c;Good dog,&#x201d; Alexa said.<br> <br>Beetle&#x2019;s tail moved very slightly in polite acknowledgment. He was perhaps the only one in the house whose reaction to Dan&#x2019;s return would be entirely uncomplicated. Even the twins, Alexa could not be entirely sure of. Dan had been away once for only a month&#x2019;s training, in Canada, when they were not yet two, and when he returned and swooped down to hug them they had been terrified of this unfamiliar giant and fled shrieking behind Alexa. Dan had been devastated. Alexa had found him in their then German garden, on a broken bench, his head in his hands, not able or inclined to be reasonable. It was a week before Tassy, the bolder of the twins, had instructed him to bathe her. And another week before Flora had silently offered him her shoes to put on. And all that time, Dan hardly spoke. He wasn&#x2019;t sulking, he was just somewhere else&#x2014;&#x201c;in the zone,&#x201d; he called it&#x2014;and there was nothing for Alexa to do but wait.<br> <br>This time, of course, she had waited for six months. She had looked after the children, walked Beetle, cooked and cleaned, serviced the car and the lawn mower and the disobliging central-heating boiler; she had mopped up the girlfriends of the junior officers, who had frequently not even met their boyfriends&#x2019; parents, cut the grass, watched countless DVDs in the evenings, joined in endless small female social diversions in the days&#x2014;&#x201c;He&#x2019;s in the Army,&#x201d; her father had said with forced joviality when she told him she had decided to marry Dan, &#x201c;so you&#x2019;ll end up an Army wife, measuring out your days in coffee spoons!&#x201d;; she had tried not to write daily emails to Dan, and certainly not ones that even hinted at the bizarre mixture of feeling both trapped and insecure that haunted her, and was never separated from her telephone.<br> <br>Once a week, there&#x2019;d been a satellite phone call to Dan, in Afghanistan. If there was any crisis or sudden action, all the communications would shut down, and if you missed your turn, you missed it and were rewarded with a particular intensity of anxiety that persisted until the men were permitted to communicate again. Worries about Isabel&#x2019;s misery at school, about Flora&#x2019;s lazy eye (she wore miniature spectacles with a patch over one lens which gave her a sweetly scholarly air), about the lump on Beetle&#x2019;s side had to be choked down even if the phone connection worked, because Dan was mentally in another place, on quite another planet. This tour, he hadn&#x2019;t even taken photographs of them all, nor the drawings the twins had done for him.<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t bear to,&#x201d; he said. He was standing among the precise piles of his kit, in their bedroom. &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t look at them last time, and I felt a shit because I couldn&#x2019;t. So, better not to take them.&#x201d; He gave a half laugh. &#x201c;I feel shit about enough, as it is.&#x201d;<br> <br>As well as those calls&#x2014;as vital as they were unsatisfactory&#x2014;Alexa rang her girlfriends on the camp daily. She rang Mo, and Franny and Sara and Prue. She also rang Dan&#x2019;s father once a week, out of affection, and her own parents, out of duty. And she rang Jack. She rang Jack almost as often as Jack rang her, which was every day or two.<br> <br>Jack Dearlove had been in Alexa&#x2019;s life since she was seven. His father had been a minor diplomat, like hers, and their peripatetic careers had brought their children together, quite by chance, in several postings, the last of which was Bonn, just before both Jack and Alexa went off to university.

Well-loved landscapes, like Tom Thomson&#x2019;s Jack Pine, appear beside some unexpected treasures like Edwin Holgate&#x2019;s Nude in a Landscape. The essays by Joan Murray and Harris give historical context to the Group of Seven, and fascinating captions provide biographical notes and insightful critiques of each member&#x2019;s style.

Reverend Earl Smith shares the most important lessons he&#x2019;s learned from years of helping inmates discover God&#x2019;s plan for them.<br><br>In 1983, twenty-seven-year-old Earl Smith arrived at San Quentin just like everyone thought he would. Labeled as a gang member and criminal from a young age, Smith was expected to do some time, but after a brush with death during a botched drug deal, Smith&#x2019;s soul was saved and his life path was altered forever.<br> <br> From that moment on, Smith knew God had an unusual mission for him, and he became the minister to the lost souls sitting on death row. For twenty-three years, Smith played chess with Charles Manson, negotiated truces between rival gangs, and bore witness to the final thoughts of many death row inmates. But most importantly, Smith helped the prisoners of San Quentin find redemption, hope, and to understand that it is still possible to find God&#x2019;s grace and mercy from behind bars.<br> <br> Edgy, insightful, and thought provoking, <i>Death Row Chaplain</i><i> </i>teaches us God&#x2019;s grace can reach anyone&#x2014;even the most desperate and lost&#x2014;and that it&#x2019;s never too late to turn our lives around.</p><p>Rev.

In many ways, I was very much like the men and women whom society has cast aside for their crimes and mistakes. When I was younger, I wanted only what many of them are seeking: acceptance, attention, and love.<br> <br>I came into the world fighting for acceptance, really from the day my parents brought me home from the hospital after my birth on January 29, 1956. I grew up on the east side of Stockton, California. We had a small house on Scotts Street, where I lived with my parents, Addie and Curtis Smith, and my sisters, Betty Jo and Sylvia, and brother, Curtis. My mother was a very peculiar person, and it didn&#x2019;t take long for me to realize that she didn&#x2019;t love me. I figured out that the best thing I could do was stay out of her sight.<br> <br>When I was four years old, I was sitting in our living room with my mother and some of her friends. A newborn baby was sitting on one of the women&#x2019;s laps. I realized the bottle was empty. &#x201c;That baby ain&#x2019;t got no milk,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>All of a sudden, my mother turned and slapped me across the face. &#x201c;Shut up, fool!&#x201d; she shouted.<br> <br>I was a little kid, so I didn&#x2019;t know that babies sometimes suck on the nipples of empty bottles to pacify them. I was only trying to help, but my mother embarrassed me in front of her friends. Unfortunately, it is one of the most indelible memories of my childhood. It seemed like every time I tried to get close to my mother, something happened to push me away.<br> A Great Friend: Ossie<p></p> <br>I realized when I was very young that my mother was always going to give the love and affection I so desired to someone else. Fortunately, my parents had hired an older woman, Ossie Pittsfield, to care for me when I was a baby. On the day my parents brought me home from the hospital, my mother handed me over to Ossie. She knew that I needed love, and she gave me every ounce of affection she had. She was one of the most influential people in my life, because she taught me how to love others. In many ways, Ossie rescued me from what would have been an otherwise miserable childhood.<br> <br>Ossie lived in our house. I slept in a bedroom with her, she fed and bathed me, and spent more time with me than my mother ever did. On special occasions, I rode the bus with Ossie to visit her brother Roy, who worked as a porter on a train that came through town a couple of times a year. She packed Roy a big lunch, and we spent a few hours with him at the train station until he left for another adventure.<br> <br>When I was six or seven years old, I came home from school and Ossie wasn&#x2019;t there. My mother told me she had sent her packing. I was devastated and so angry. I went door to door in our neighborhood, frantically searching for Ossie, even though my mother had warned me not to do so. I found her living at a friend&#x2019;s house a couple of blocks away; she&#x2019;d rented a room there so she would be close enough to check on me. When my mother found out I&#x2019;d been looking for Ossie, she spanked me for disobeying her. It didn&#x2019;t stop me from going back to Ossie&#x2019;s house the next day and many days thereafter.<br> <br>In many ways, it was at this point in my life at which I stopped caring. If my mother was determined to take away the person who mattered most to me, I didn&#x2019;t think there was much in the world worth living for. From that point forward, I took a turn for the worse and rebelled against my parents and any other authority figures.<br> <br>As I grew older, though, I began to realize that my mother was incapable of loving me. I&#x2019;ve learned over the years that, if people know better, they typically do better. I don&#x2019;t think my mother had the capacity to raise me. When I was older, I learned that my mother had been married to another man when she was very young; he had been physically abusive. My mother ran away from him and his family and fled from Texas to California with her mother. My mom wasn&#x2019;t even sixteen years old at the time.<br> <br>After she married my father, I was the youngest of their four children and, by the time I was born, my mother apparently wasn&#x2019;t interested in raising another child. I hated my mother then for not loving me, but she didn&#x2019;t know any better. She gave whatever love she had to my older brother, which made me resent her even more and made me very envious of Curtis. At the age of fifteen, Curtis fathered a child, and I watched as my mother poured all of her love and affection on my nephew.<br> A Good Dad<p></p> <br>I was much closer to my father, who loved me and was my protector. My father was the man of the house, and when he was home my mother tended to leave me alone. My father was born in Horatio, Arkansas, and served in the U.S. Navy during World War II. After being discharged from the Navy, he worked for twenty-eight years at the Sharpe Army Depot near Lathrop, California, which is a military distribution and storage facility. My father often had three jobs at once to make ends meet, as he also worked as a mechanic and at a local cannery. He was president of the local American Federation of Government Employees union, which gave him a tremendous amount of pride and power. Politicians would come to our house to talk with my father about getting votes. The majority whip in the U.S. Congress, John McFall, was one of his closest associates.<br> <br>Even though my dad wasn&#x2019;t home much, he still found time to serve as my Scoutmaster in the Boy Scouts and coach my Little League Baseball teams. He taught me how to fish and hunt. My dad was the superintendent of our Sunday school, and a choir director and trustee at our church. He instilled the importance of education in my siblings and me from an early age. My father was a high school graduate, took a lot of courses from the University of California&#x2013;Berkeley, and even taught courses on labor relations. He made sure every one of his children did well in school and knew what was happening in the world. He made each of us read the newspaper and to have a report ready for him when he got home. Eventually, all of his children earned college degrees.<br> <br>One of the most frightening episodes of my childhood was when my father was hospitalized for nearly a month. I was around twelve and too young to realize it at the time, but my father was an alcoholic. I had seen him drinking, but it grew progressively worse. My father had ulcers on his liver, and surgeons had to intervene. It seemed that his entire body was poisoned by alcohol. I was devastated that my dad wasn&#x2019;t home. My mother wouldn&#x2019;t take me to the hospital to see him, so I called him every night to make sure he was okay.<br> <br>One day, I persuaded one of our neighbors, Mr. Holloway, whom the neighborhood kids called &#x201c;Old Dude,&#x201d; to take me to see my dad at the hospital. I brought along our family dog, Duke, an enormous German shepherd. My dad loved Duke and took him nearly everywhere he went. He often put Duke in the front seat of his car and put a hat on his head, so that all the kids in our neighborhood would see him.<br> <br>When Mr. Holloway took Duke and me to the hospital to see my dad, I walked up to the window of his first-floor room. I put Duke&#x2019;s paws on the windowsill and knocked on the glass. My dad saw us and started crying. I didn&#x2019;t know it, but the doctors had told my dad he probably wasn&#x2019;t going to live. When I later heard my mother talking to her friends about my dad&#x2019;s condition, I took his gun and hid it under my bed. It was a pearl-handled Smith &amp; Wesson .38 revolver. I figured if my dad died, I was going to kill myself. I knew there wouldn&#x2019;t be anyone left to care for me. I also knew I needed a gun to protect myself if my father wasn&#x2019;t around.<br> <br>Thankfully, the doctors were able to save my father and he lived to be eighty-two years old.<br> Over Time, More Understanding<p></p> <br>When I was twenty-six, my parents divorced. My parents believed that I would be happy they were splitting up, but I actually wished they&#x2019;d remained married. I was really sad, because I wanted my children to see them intact. After all I&#x2019;ve told you, you may wonder why. There&#x2019;s more to the story.<br> <br>My mother and I are not as close as I am sure both of us would like, for many reasons, what transpired during my childhood, and how I chose to live my life. But she&#x2019;s my mom. Do I wish I had a better relationship with her? Of course.<br> <br>My mother celebrated her eightieth birthday at the house in which I grew up. As I walked through the door, the videographer asked me, &#x201c;Who are you, and what relationship do you have with Addie?&#x201d; I told him I was her son. He said, &#x201c;Yeah, a lot of people here are her kids, but I would like your name for the video.&#x201d; I realized at that point how many people my mother had affected in a positive way. The people in our house were homeless mothers, women who had been in prison, and ministers. My mother had helped so many during her life and, as I walked through the house, I thought about my life up to that point, and wondered what I could have done differently.<br> <br>My mother&#x2019;s attitude toward me has not changed over the years. She still has few positive things to say about me, and chooses to spend time with nonfamily members rather than with my family or her grandchildren. That said, I still come away with the same conclusion: My mother just did not have the capacity to bond with and love me the way I wanted or needed. Of course, this hurt. I even thought that when I had children, she would somehow change and love them the way she didn&#x2019;t love me. That hasn&#x2019;t happened.<br> <br>When I think of what things I could have done differently, first, I could have fought to develop a true relationship with her. I knew how to fight for everything else I wanted, but I didn&#x2019;t try to have a permanent place in her life. Second, had my actions, the things she heard about me, the people I harmed, and the way I lived my life as a young man been different, perhaps she would have found it easier to display some level of love toward me.<br> <br>Shortly after I took a job as the chaplain at San Quentin Prison, my father decided he was finally ready to stop drinking. He said he was going to a Veterans Affairs hospital to seek treatment. When we arrived at a facility in Martinez, California, I admitted my father, and Betty Jo, Sylvia, and I attended family therapy with him for the next several weeks. Eventually, my dad became very involved in my children&#x2019;s lives, taking them to school some days, and attending their sporting events. My children always played their best games when my dad was in attendance. I guess they liked showing off for him.<br> <br>Each of my parents eventually remarried, and my dad moved back to Arkansas. He became the pastor of Mt. Zion United Methodist Church in his hometown of Horatio. Shortly before my dad died on August 21, 2009, my wife and I took our kids to see him. My children went fishing with him and our family had our last fish fry together. It was a good way for my children to remember him.<br> Siblings<p></p> <br>When my father wasn&#x2019;t around during my childhood, my sister Betty Jo was my protector. She loved me and treated me as if I was her child. Betty Jo looked after me, made me study, and always made me feel special. I protected Betty Jo, too. I can remember standing in the parking lot of our church when I was probably only eight or nine years old. One of our friends&#x2014;we called him &#x201c;Rabbit&#x201d;&#x2014;was picking on Betty Jo and pulling her hair. I ran up behind him and tackled him in front of everyone. My dad must have been proud of what I&#x2019;d done, because he actually took me to get ice cream after church, and I&#x2019;m pretty sure Rabbit never messed with my sister again.<br> <br>When we were much older, I learned that Betty Jo and her husband had gotten into a physical altercation. I was attending college in Dallas at the time, and I jumped on the first plane to Modesto, California. A friend picked me up at the airport, and I found Betty Jo&#x2019;s husband and beat him up. Then I got back on a plane to Dallas and got the heck out of Modesto. Looking back, it was a foolish thing; I had claimed my life was changed, and was studying for a degree in religion at the time. But I&#x2019;m always going to protect my sisters. They were there to protect me when I needed them most.<br> <br>By the time Betty Jo was in high school, she was very good at concealing my delinquent behavior from my mother. She took an unbelievable amount of verbal abuse from my mom. I don&#x2019;t think my mother wanted me to be close to anyone. Betty Jo was student body president of her high school, graduated with a perfect 4.0 grade point average, and received a full scholarship to Stanford University in Palo Alto, California. Betty Jo wasn&#x2019;t far from home, but I was heartbroken when she left. She managed to come home a couple of times a month, bringing me books to read and making sure I was getting by.<br> <br>In a lot of ways, my sister Sylvia was my soul mate. Whenever I was sick, Sylvia was sick. When I was ten, I had the mumps at the same time that Sylvia did.Even when I was away at college, Sylvia and I always seemed to be ill at the same time.<br> <br>As I said earlier, my brother, Curtis, was my mother&#x2019;s favorite son. They were always doing things together. I never understood why my mother liked spending so much time with my brother and not me. It was partly my fault, because I wouldn&#x2019;t have wanted to associate with the kind of person I became when I was older. Curtis was a really good athlete, and he probably could have played college baseball, if not in the Major Leagues. He didn&#x2019;t like to do the things I liked to do, which were hunting and fishing with my dad and running the streets.<br> My First Brush with an Execution<p></p> <br>Curtis and I shared the same bedroom until he left for the Air Force after graduating from high school. We spent many nights talking about life, the way kids do. We had a transistor radio that we hid under our bed from our parents. On the morning of January 17, 1962, Curtis and I listened to news reports as the state of California prepared to execute Elbert Carter in the gas chamber at San Quentin Prison. Carter was the son of a Stockton minister and, years later, I would attend college with his brother. I was only five years old at the time, so I didn&#x2019;t have a complete understanding of what was happening. I certainly didn&#x2019;t comprehend the moral and political issues surrounding an execution, but I still have vivid memories of that morning.<br> <br>Carter was executed for killing a police officer. On the morning of April 22, 1960, a Stockton police officer, George Woehrle, had attempted to arrest Carter at his parents&#x2019; home. Carter, who was twenty-three at the time, had been searching for work. He was on the eligibility list for employment as a psychiatric technician at the Stockton State Hospital, and had even taken examinations to become a probationary patrolman with the Stockton police department. A good life seemed to be ahead of him. However, Carter had been romantically involved with a younger woman who had given birth to their child, and an arrest warrant was issued for him on charges of statutory rape.<br> <br>Woehrle picked up Carter at his parents&#x2019; home and they left in the police officer&#x2019;s unmarked station wagon. At some point, a struggle ensued inside the car and it stopped about three miles from Carter&#x2019;s home. During the criminal trial, witnesses testified they saw Woehrle and Carter fighting, and that Carter shot Woehrle multipl...</p><h2>Matthew: A Commentary for Bible Students (Wesleyan Bible Commentary) (Wesley Bible Commentary)</h2><p><p>The Matthew commentary explores Matthew's vision of discipleship and how to live the Christian life when one's traditional moorings are under attack.</p> <p>The preaching of the Kingdom provided a new lens by which Jesus demonstrated the meaning of the Old Testament for His followers.

Thanks to Sachs's superb guidance, the Physics comes alive as a profound dialectical inquiry whose insights into the enduring questions about nature, cause, change, time, and the 'infinite' are still pertinent today. Using such guided studies in class has been exhilarating both for myself and my students."&nbsp;</i> &#x2013;&#x2013;Leon R.

There has been a plethora of books written over the last twenty years regarding the revelatory gifts of the Holy Spirit for today. Jim's book stands out for several excellent reasons. First, it is Biblically based. So much of what has recently been written is highly subjective with little Bible to help the average person understand true foundations for having spiritual eyes to see and ears to hear. Secondly, I applaud Jim's focus on the priesthood of every believer. It is everyone's birthright, who belongs to Christ Jesus, to be led by the Spirit. Jim has done an excellent job at both de-mystifying revelation and putting it in hands of everyday Christians. Thirdly, this book does not consist of merely rehashing popular insights regarding revelation. Many of Driscoll's points are both fresh and extremely helpful. For example, chapter 9, which discusses how deeply God values kindness and the Biblical relationship of kindness with seeing and applying revelation will prove to be of immense help to many who are both starting out in revelation and those who are experienced in it. Thank you, Jim, for writing this! It will encourage, train, and safeguard many, many people in the years ahead. --Marc A.

Nightmare vied with banality: the severed leg of a policeman rotted in the gutter, half covered by a girlie magazine, blood-speckled pages fluttering in the evening breeze. <br>Just hours before, downtown Hanoi had been hit by four dozen bombs and missiles launched from a wave of Chinese aircraft. The daytime attack had pockmarked the already battered city, starting fires and destroying several buildings. The fires burned largely unabated. The relief forces were drained, and much of their equipment was exhausted as well. A number of fire trucks and ambulances had been damaged by the bombings; a few sat crushed by debris from the buildings they had tried to save. Others sat abandoned where they had run out of fuel. Fire trucks and ambulances still operating no longer used their sirens, as if they were too weak even to sound an alarm. <br>The center of town had been hit hard. The former French-dot-com bank, once a landmark, was now a burned-out hulk. A residential high-rise not far away had lost about a third of its tower; in the dimming light the jagged edges of bricks looked like an arm rising from the earth, about to rake its claws on the city. <br>And yet, despite the destruction, the city continued to struggle on, its breath labored yet real. Elements of the bizarre mixed with the defiant and practical. In the same street where citizens had cowered in basements and behind whatever thin shelter they could find an hour before, a parade of black Korean limousines now delivered elegant matrons and twenty-something <i>fashionistas</i> to the Ambasario Hotel for an annual benefit for Hanoi orphans. The women wore brilliantly colored dresses, their hot pink and fuchsia silks a militant stance against the Chinese onslaught. <br>Zeus Murphy stopped on the street to let a pair of women pass. The soldier felt like a misplaced voyeur, an uninvited guest at a private carnival. He was certainly an outsider&#x2014;a U.S. Army major dropped into the middle of an exotic land&#x2014;though he was also more of a participant in the war than any of the dozens of people walking past him in the street. <br>Zeus watched the women pick up the skirts of their dresses and step over the dried splatters of blood as they walked across the concrete apron to the hotel&#x2019;s front door. A path had been swept clear for them; a small pile of glass lay a few feet from Zeus&#x2019;s boots, the fragments glittering with the hint of light from the hotel&#x2019;s interior. <br>Most of the women were ex-pats, the spouses and, in a few cases, daughters of men working in Hanoi or nearby. Zeus wondered if they had come out in defiance or to seek some sort of solidarity in misery. There was no longer a reliable route of escape for civilians from the city or the country. Air transport was close to impossible; commercial flights had ended the day before, not only out of Hanoi but also Saigon much farther south. (Saigon was what everyone except foreigners called Ho Chi Minh City.) Even the American embassy had difficulty arranging for helicopters, although it had two flights scheduled for later that day. <br>The highways south and the sea ports were still open, though how long that would last was anyone&#x2019;s guess. <br>Realizing he was late, Zeus started forward, only to bump into a woman who&#x2019;d been trying to squeeze past him on the pavement. The woman jerked her head around and put up her hands. He reached to grab her, thinking she was going to fall. <br>She staggered back, regaining her balance. The look on her face was one of dread, as if she had been touched by a ghoul. <br>Zeus put up his hands, motioning that he meant no harm. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s OK,&#x201d; he told her in English. He searched for the Vietnamese words for <i>sorry</i> amid his scant vocabulary. <br> <i>&#x201c;Xin loi,&#x201d;</i> he told her. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. Excuse me.&#x201d; <br>She took another step, then turned and walked quickly toward the hotel, her pace just under a trot. <br>Zeus waited until she reached the door before starting again. He, too, was going to the hotel, though not for the show. He had to meet someone in the bar. <br>Two women dressed in plain gray pantsuits, neither much younger than fifty, stood at the doorway to the lobby. They had AK-47s in their hands. Zeus nodded as he approached. His white face made it clear that he was a foreigner&#x2014;and not Chinese&#x2014;and that was all the pass he needed to get in. <br>At the very start of the war, the Vietnamese had posted soldiers at the large hotels used by foreigners, more as a gesture of reassurance than security. The soldiers had long since been shifted to more important tasks. Some of the hotels had replaced them with their own security forces, though in most cases these men, too, had left, answering the call for citizens to report to local defense units, a kind of home guard that was organized around different residential areas in the city. Though trained in name only, some of these units had been transported farther north and west, to supplement regular army units facing the Chinese. <br>The units included women as well as men of all ages. Posters emblazoned with slogans like COURAGE and FIGHT ON were just now appearing on the walls of the city; the state television channel had broadcast interviews with women who had fought in the home guard during the last conflict with China. Some were now close to eighty; all said they were ready to fight again. <br>Zeus lowered his head as he passed a foreign camera crew standing at the end of the hallway. They had obviously come to record the charity event, but were being harangued by a hotel manager, who kept waving his hands in front of the cameraman&#x2019;s face. The journalist looked exasperated; he clearly had no idea why the man was objecting. <br>The hallway was dimly lit, with three of every four lightbulbs removed. People clustered along the sides. Many cupped cigarettes in their hands. Smoke hung heavy in the passage, adding to the shadows. It looked like a scene from a 1930s noir film: gangsters hiding at the far end of the hall, an undercover detective weaving through the unfamiliar darkness toward his fate. <br>Even in the mixed crowd of Westerners and Asians, Zeus looked out of place. His civilian jeans and casual collared T-shirt did little to disguise his military bearing. People glanced in his direction and made way. <br>The etched-glass door to the bar was blocked by a crowd of people on the other side. He pushed against it gently, gradually increasing pressure when they failed to move. <br>&#x201c;Excuse me,&#x201d; he said, in gruff English, pushing a little harder. He eased up and then jerked his hand so that the door banged against the bodies. Finally they got the message and began to part. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br> <i>The opening door caught</i> the eye of Ric Kerfer, who was sitting at the bar across the room, angled so he could see the doors without seeming to pay too much attention to them. His eyes sorted through the crowd, waiting to see if whoever was coming through was worth his interest. <br>Kerfer wasn&#x2019;t surprised that the bar was packed&#x2014;bars were always popular when the world was going to hell&#x2014;but it was interesting that there were so many foreigners still left in Hanoi. When he&#x2019;d left the week before, it seemed like everyone was angling for a way out. Now it looked like everyone wanted to stay and find out what the Chinese were really like. <br>Maybe it was this way on the <i>Titanic</i> as well. <br>Kerfer had been here for more than a half hour, nursing a single Jack Daniel&#x2019;s straight up. Ordinarily in that time he&#x2019;d have had four or five or six. But he&#x2019;d decided Vietnam was no longer a good place to get even mildly drunk. There was too much desperation in the air, too many people with little to lose. <br>That was when you had to keep your wits about you. The man pushed inexplicably past his breaking point by an accidental event was infinitely more dangerous than a soldier doing his duty. <br>Kerfer had felt the same sensation in Baghdad, in Yemen, in Syria. In Tripoli, he&#x2019;d sensed things were past the breaking point, and yet he&#x2019;d stayed on an extra day, wanting to make sure his job was truly done. It was a foolish bit of overzealousness that had almost cost him his life. <br>You had to do your duty. But your duty rarely called for you to die. Or rather, it called for you to die only under the most leveraged circumstances. Circumstances that Lieutenant Ric Kerfer, a United States Navy SEAL, could no longer imagine. <br>Kerfer leaned back on his barstool, recognizing Zeus. Right away he noticed that the Army major had changed. Part of it was physical&#x2014;Zeus was banged up. Kerfer could tell from the way he moved, shuffling the way an injured man did to divert attention from his injuries. <br>SEALs were always covering for some ligament strain or muscle tear, pretending they didn&#x2019;t need surgery that would end their time on the firing line. They might hold their shoulders in or be selective in how they leaned their weight, subtly trying to lessen the potential for more injury. <br>It had nothing to with pain, per se&#x2014;you got used to pain, unfortunately. It was more that you tried to keep whatever defect you&#x2019;d acquired from being seen. <br>But there was more than that. There was something now in Zeus&#x2019;s frown, something in the way he glared people out of his way. <br>Zeus Murphy was now an extremely dangerous man, Kerfer realized. More dangerous than the enemy. <br>He finished his drink, then pushed the glass toward the bartender. <br>&#x201c;Fill it,&#x201d; he told the man, a Vietnamese who spoke English well, though with a French accent. &#x201c;And draw a beer. I have a friend coming.&#x201d; <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br> <i>Zeus spotted Kerfer</i> at the other end of the bar. He&#x2019;d grown to like the SEAL officer, even though like most SEALs Kerfer barely pretended to tolerate him. Kerfer&#x2019;s rank as a lieutenant was the equivalent of a captain in the Army, which meant that Zeus outranked him, but it was clear that rank had exactly zero meaning to Kerfer. <br>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; said Zeus when he finally reached Kerfer. <br>&#x201c;Hey yourself, Major.&#x201d; <br>Zeus frowned at him. Kerfer smirked. <br>&#x201c;Ain&#x2019;t nobody in this place who can&#x2019;t figure out what the two of us are and who we work for,&#x201d; said Kerfer. &#x201c;And not a one of them could give a shit. Here&#x2019;s a beer.&#x201d; <br>Zeus was surprised to find that not only the contents but the glass was cold. He took a drink; it was heady and seductive. <br>&#x201c;I heard you had some fun north of Haiphong,&#x201d; said Kerfer. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re becoming a legend.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Perry&#x2019;s kinda pissed off I hear.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Screw him.&#x201d; Zeus ran his fingers along the outside of the glass; the cold felt almost exotic against the tips. <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re coming over to the dark side, Major. Glad to have you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s just say my eyes are open. You talked to Perry?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;He talked to me.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You told him we were meeting?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Why would I do that?&#x201d; asked Kerfer. <br>Zeus suddenly felt wary. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m surprised you&#x2019;re back in Hanoi. I hear you&#x2019;re a wanted man.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;They don&#x2019;t know they want me,&#x201d; said Kerfer. His men had killed a squad of Vietnamese soldiers who had strayed into their path while they were rescuing an American scientist from the Chinese&#x2014;at least that was Kerfer&#x2019;s version. The Vietnamese had protested vehemently to the ambassador and to Perry, both of whom had denied they had any knowledge of what had happened. <br>&#x201c;They wanted what I brought more than they wanted revenge,&#x201d; added Kerfer. &#x201c;Revenge isn&#x2019;t going to help them. Never helps anyone. Remember that, Major.&#x201d; <br>Kerfer was about the last person Zeus needed a lecture from. He changed the subject. &#x201c;You finished the shipments?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;All done. I suspect they&#x2019;ve used them already.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;So why are you still here?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I was told to sit and wait, in case I might be more useful in the future.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Perry said that?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Perry&#x2019;s not my boss,&#x201d; said Kerfer. &#x201c;He wants me out. He wants you out, too.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d; Zeus set down his glass. He glanced at it, and was surprised to see it was more than half gone. &#x201c;He told you that?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;He was in a talkative mood.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I have something I wanted to ask you about,&#x201d; Zeus told Kerfer. <br>&#x201c;Go ahead.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t a good place.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;As good as any. Nobody&#x2019;s listening to us, Major. Look around.&#x201d; <br>Zeus shook his head. <br>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; said Kerfer. &#x201c;Lead the way.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I thought you&#x2019;d have scouted out a place.&#x201d; <br>Kerfer laughed. &#x201c;Follow me.&#x201d; <br>The SEAL was a powerfully built man, with broad shoulders and legs that worked like piston rods. He exuded a certain don&#x2019;t-mess-with-me energy, and the crowd parted as he got up from his seat and led Zeus into a supply room at the back end of the bar. He didn&#x2019;t bother flipping on a light, and there was barely enough to see around the tall shelves of supplies as he walked to the back of the room. There he paused in front of a steel door; he fiddled with the knob for a moment, then pulled the door open, having picked the lock. Zeus hadn&#x2019;t even seen him take the lock-picking tools from his pocket. <br>&#x201c;Out here,&#x201d; Kerfer told him. <br>Zeus followed up a short flight of steps to a long, narrow corridor. A glass door, all but one of its panes missing, stood at the end. There was no doorknob on the inside; Kerfer reached through and took hold of the small handle to unlatch it. They emerged on a wide patio. <br>A man stood against the far rail, smoking a cigar. <br>&#x201c;Take a walk,&#x201d; Kerfer said to him in English. Then he added another few words in Vietnamese. <i>&#x201c;Bo?.&#x201d;</i> <br>The man frowned, but stuck the cigar in his mouth and left, going through the way they had just come. Kerfer, meanwhile, walked over to the edge of the patio, which was bounded by a short, thick wall. The space overlooked a yard paved with small stones that was part of the hotel restaurant&#x2019;s outdoor dining area; it was closed to patrons. <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think <i>Bo?</i> really means <i>go</i>,&#x201d; said Kerfer. &#x201c;More like &#x2018;abandon all hope ye who enter here.&#x2019;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Your Vietnamese is getting better.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It gets the job done.&#x201d; <br>Zeus looked around. They were alone. <br>&#x201c;I need to get somebody out of the country,&#x201d; said Zeus. <br>&#x201c;Your girlfriend?&#x201d; <br>Zeus felt his cheeks warm. <br>&#x201c;Relax, Major, I&#x2019;m not your chaperone,&#x201d; said Kerfer. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t give a crap about where you dip your wick.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Listen&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you throw her on a military transport? There&#x2019;s a helo coming into the embassy in a few hours.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Perry won&#x2019;t go for it.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just a gofer. I bring things in, not take them out. When we left with the scientist, we had a destroyer.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You think I can bribe some of the people you&#x2019;re working with?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;The nonmilitary people? Sure, you can bribe &#x2019;em.&#x201d; The SEAL rubbed his face. &#x201c;Whether they can help you or not is another question.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;How much will they want?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;The question is how much you can trust them,&#x201d; answered Kerfer. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not paying attention. I&#x2019;d say the way things are going, nobody&#x2019;s going to be able to help you pretty soon. Where is she?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know for sure,&#x201d; said Zeus. &#x201c;A military prison. I&#x2019;m working on it.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Why is she in jail?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a long story&nbsp;&#x2026; She saved the life of a POW that the Vietnamese wanted to kill. So she was arrested&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Save it,&#x201d; said Kerfer. &#x201c;Your best bet is to get her out on an embassy flight.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That ain&#x2019;t gonna work.&#x201d; <br>Kerfer shrugged. He pushed off from the wall. <br>&#x201c;I have something else I need to talk about,&#x201d; said Zeus. <br>Kerfer stopped. <br>&#x201c;Yeah?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I need to get in touch with your c...</p><h2>The Inspirational Writings of Robert H.

William Phelps, a veteran true-crime writer, explores the 2004 Nashua, New Hampshire, murder of Jeanne Dominico by her 14-year-old daughter and her daughter�s 18-year-old boyfriend. Once the early facts of the crime are reported, however, the details of the investigation (neighbors� and townspeople�s statements, police reports, suspect interrogations) become repetitious. Happily, J. Charles�s narration provides the tension needed to keep listeners engaged. Charles sounds as if he�s truly interested in what Billy Sullivan�s unstable life was like before he met Nicole Kasinskas and what led her to assist him in her mother�s brutal murder. Charles avoids using character voices yet still manages to convey the whiny, self-indulgent attitudes held by the overweight girl and the mentally shaky young man.

Graded down to like new because of former owner bookplates inside. Then we send you a confirmation e-mail. We appreciate your business and welcome any questions</p><p>Superb revisionist biography not only of Meyer Lansky but also of the supposed American-Italian crime corporation called the Mafia; by the author of The Kingdom (1981) and Ford (1986). Lacey's larger message is that the Mafia is really like local groups of Freemasons, with sometimes quite active links between one another but not congealed into a centrally structured organization. There is ``no shadowy General Motors of crime.'' Moreover, the Mafia's way of life, Lacey shows, is less than mythic: ``The average mafioso, and much of his self-esteem, stem from the stereotypes that have been created by the media...Their lives are pale copies of the vigor and creativity of the straight world--and the clever ones like Meyer Lansky learn to copy its honesty as well.'' Lansky several times tried to set up businesses in the straight world, only to have them go under and find himself still stuck in the world of gambling. He suffered a brutal youth on New York's Lower East Side but early was taken under the wing of Arnold Rothstein, a.k.a. ``The Brain,'' who kept all his criminal businesses discrete--and kept their books in his head. Lansky, too, became famed for his head for figures, as well as for his lack of greed and his honesty in sharing. He was misquoted as saying that ``the Mafia'' was bigger than US Steel (he said ``organized crime'' was), and his reputed $300 million nest egg was fantasy, as Lacey makes clear. Lansky was a genius among his fellow thugs, but died almost broke while living modestly in retirement in Miami and caring for his ulcers and triple bypass. In 1974, he phoned Lee Strasberg to tell him, ``You did good'' (as the Hyman Roth/Lansky character in Godfather II): ``The deep voice on the phone was flesh and blood seeking contact with the celluloid image....'' Shoots huge holes in the great American gangster myth--and its many bad reporters. Enthralling. (Thirty-two pages of b&amp;w photographs--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>This biography of the notorious hoodlum by the author of The Kingdom succeeds in deglamorizing a gangland figure around whom all sorts of mythology was created, both during his lifetime and after. A product of the ghetto on Manhattan's Lower East Side, Lansky (1902?-1983) spent his adolescence developing the conviction that, if there were an honest and a dishonest way of achieving a goal, the dishonest way was preferable. Like many members of organized crime in his era, he became a specialist, working with casinos. He was rigidly honest about not cheating the public and paying his partners their due. His family life was a horror: Lansky's first wife became semi-psychotic and their three children had miserable lives; his second marriage was somewhat better. The media-generated image of a financial eminence grise worth hundreds of millions of dollars, the gangland chairman of the board, was largely fictional.

His experiences make him uniquely qualified to write about Pope Benedict XVI. Fox delivers a blistering indictment of Ratzinger, from his early career to his years as chief Inquisitor, from his protection of reactionary groups like Opus Dei to his role in covering up the pedophilia crisis. But Fox also sets forth his vision for a new Catholicism--one that is truly universal and celebrates critical thinking, diversity, and justice.&nbsp;Author Matthew Fox appeared on Democracy Now on February 28, 2013. See the interview here: http://www.democracynow.org/2013/2/28/fascism_in_the_church_ex_priest</p><p>After being forbidden to teach theology by then-Cardinal Ratzinger in 1988, Matthew Fox was welcomed into the Anglican community, where he started the University of Creation Spirituality. He is now a visiting scholar, and operates a successful program for the education of inner-city teenagers. Matthew Fox lives in Oakland, CA.<br>&#x201c;Indeed this book, published two years before Benedict XVI resigned, goes a long way toward a detailed list of reasons for Benedict's failed papacy.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>The First Men in the Moon (Penguin Classics)</h2><p>When penniless businessman Mr Bedford retreats to the Kent coast to write a play, he meets by chance the brilliant Dr Cavor, an absent-minded scientist on the brink of developing a material that blocks gravity.

Now it is the winter of 1941. As the Germans, with England and France on their side, slam deep into Russia, Stalin&#x2019;s terrible machine fights for its life. But the agreements of world leaders do not touch the hearts of soldiers. The war between Germany and Russia is rocked by men with the courage to aim their guns in a new direction.<br> &nbsp;<br> England is the first to be shaken. Following the suspicious death of Winston Churchill, with his staunch anti-Nazi views, a small cabal begins to imagine the unthinkable in a nation long famous for respecting the rule of law. With civil liberties hanging by a thread, a conspiracy forms against the powers that be. What will this daring plan mean for the European war as a whole?<br> &nbsp;<br> Meanwhile, in America, a woman who has met Hitler face-to-face urges her countrymen to wake up to his evil. For the time being, the United States is fighting only Japan&#x2014;and the war is not going as well as Washington would like. Can Roosevelt keep his grip on the country&#x2019;s imagination?<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Coup d&#x2019;Etat</i> captures how war makes for the strangest of bedfellows. A freethinking Frenchman fights side by side with racist Nazis. A Czech finds himself on the dusty front lines of the Spanish Civil War, gunning for Germany&#x2019;s Nationalist allies. A German bomber pilot courts a half-Polish, half-Jewish beauty in Bialystock. And the Jews in Germany, though trapped under Hitler&#x2019;s fist, are as yet protected by his fear of looking bad before the world&#x2014;and by an outspoken Catholic bishop.<br> &nbsp;<br> With his spectacular command of character, coincidence, and military and political strategies, Harry Turtledove continues a passionate, unmatched saga of a World War II composed of different enemies, different allies&#x2014;and hurtling toward a horrific moment. For a diabolical new weapon is about to be unleashed, not by the United States, but by Japan, in a tactic that will shock the world.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Coup d&#x2019;Etat</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Turtledove&#x2019;s masterful presentation of an alternate WWII reaches its fourth volume with its quality undiminished. . . .

Pete McGill hadn&#x2019;t expected it to be anything else. And the fierce Philippine sun beat down on him even though it was January. The past few years, he&#x2019;d served in Peking and Shanghai. He was used to winter blowing straight down from Siberia. This muggy tropical heat, by contrast, seemed like too much of a good thing.<br><br>He still wasn&#x2019;t as steady on his pins as he wished he were, either. The bomb in Shanghai that killed his ladylove came much too close to finishing him, too. The docs here did as good a job of patching him up as they could, and he&#x2019;d had time to heal. All the same, an ankle ached and a shoulder twinged every time he took a step. His face was set in a permanent grimace, not least so nobody would notice him wincing and try to send him back to the hospital.<br><br>Or maybe no one would bother any which way. It looked to Pete as if they&#x2019;d take anybody with a pulse right now. A fireboat played streams of water on a burning barge. Whatever was going up didn&#x2019;t seem to care. Black, greasy, stinking smoke rose high into the sky.<br><br>That wasn&#x2019;t the only fire burning around here, either&#x2014;nowhere close. Pete coughed harder than he usually did after his first morning cigarette. Jap bombing raids had hit the airports and the harbor hard. Now the only question was when the slant-eyed little monkeys would try to land an invasion force. Pete was sure it wouldn&#x2019;t be long.<br><br>Maybe all the smoke here would keep them from bombing accurately. Maybe . . .<br><br>&#x201c;Out of the fucking way, Corporal, goddammit!&#x201d; somebody bellowed behind Pete.<br><br>&#x201c;Sorry.&#x201d; He sidestepped as fast as he could, which wasn&#x2019;t very. A petty officer went back to yelling at the Filipino gun crew manhandling an antiaircraft gun into place. The swab jockey must have served here for a while, because he was as fluently profane in Tagalog as he was in English.<br><br>Pete picked his way through the chaos toward the light cruiser Boise. The U.S. Asiatic Fleet wasn&#x2019;t very big. This part of the world was too close to Japanese waters for the USA to risk much around here. Chances were that meant the Philippines would fall, something the Marine tried hard not to think about.<br><br>Bomb fragments scarred and dented the Boise&#x2019;s metalwork, but she hadn&#x2019;t taken any direct hits. If&#x2014;no, when&#x2014;Japanese planes came back . . . with luck, she wouldn&#x2019;t be here. Exhaust from her funnels meant she could get going in a hurry. She could, and she probably would.<br><br>But she hadn&#x2019;t yet. Mooring lines and a gangplank still tethered her to the wharf. Ignoring the pain in his leg, Pete strode up the gangplank and saluted the fresh-faced ensign standing at the far end of it. &#x201c;Permission to come aboard, sir?&#x201d; he asked the officer of the deck.<br><br>After returning the salute, the kid asked, &#x201c;And you are . . . ?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Corporal Peter McGill, sir, reporting as ordered.&#x201d;<br><br>The ensign checked the papers in the clipboard he carried in his left hand. &#x201c;McGill . . . Yes, here you are.&#x201d; He made a check mark with a mechanical pencil he pulled from his breast pocket. The United States might be at war, but that didn&#x2019;t mean you didn&#x2019;t have to dot every i and cross every t. Not yet it didn&#x2019;t, anyhow. Once the sacred check mark went into place, the youngster unbent enough to add, &#x201c;Permission granted.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you, sir.&#x201d; As soon as Pete set foot on the ship, he turned and saluted the Stars and Stripes at the stern. The flag fluttered in the warm, moist breeze.<br><br>&#x201c;Dalrymple!&#x201d; the ensign called. As if by magic, a tall, redheaded able seaman appeared beside him. &#x201c;Take Corporal, uh, McGill to the Marines&#x2019; quarters. We&#x2019;ll let them decide how best to use him.&#x201d; As if catching himself at that, he asked Pete, &#x201c;You can serve a five-inch gun, can&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, yes, sir,&#x201d; Pete answered at once. Marines aboard battleships and cruisers often manned the big ships&#x2019; secondary armament. The Boise fought other ships with half a dozen long six-inch guns mounted in three turrets. The stubbier five-inchers and a variety of smaller, quick-firing weapons tried to keep planes off her.<br><br>When they weren&#x2019;t serving the secondary armament, shipboard Marines also did duty as constables. Pete didn&#x2019;t look forward to that. He wanted to fight Japs, not his own countrymen. Along with everything Hirohito&#x2019;s bastards had done to him, he had Vera to pay them back for, too. A million slanties might be enough for that. Two would definitely be better, though.<br><br>&#x201c;Come on with me, Corporal. I&#x2019;ll show you where you can stow your duffel and all,&#x201d; Dalrymple said.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m coming,&#x201d; Pete said. The sailor took long, quick steps. Keeping up with him made Pete&#x2019;s ankle whimper, but he took no notice of it.<br><br>He knew about where he&#x2019;d be going, but not exactly. He&#x2019;d served aboard two destroyers and a battleship before going to Peking, but never a cruiser. Steps between decks might almost have been ladders: the treads were that narrow and steep. He managed to stay close to Dalrymple, anyhow.<br><br>Two corporals and two sergeants were playing pinochle in the cramped bunkroom to which the able seaman led him. They glanced up with no particular interest or liking. But one of the two-stripers looked vaguely familiar. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re Joe Orsatti, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; Pete said.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d; The other guy&#x2019;s swarthy face scrunched up as he eyed Pete in a new way. &#x201c;We were in the Brooks together, weren&#x2019;t we? Sorry, Mac, but screw me if I remember your handle.&#x201d; His New York City accent might have been even more clotted than Pete&#x2019;s.<br><br>&#x201c;McGill,&#x201d; Pete said, and stuck out his hand. Orsatti reached for it. Their trial of strength was a push, or near enough. Pete chucked his duffel onto a top bunk. He wasn&#x2019;t surprised to run into somebody with whom he&#x2019;d served before. The Marines were a small club, and noncoms in the Corps a smaller one.<br><br>Orsatti introduced Pete to the other card players. They switched from pinochle to poker. Pete lost a little, won a little, lost a little more. He was down five bucks when the general-quarters klaxon hooted. He hadn&#x2019;t heard that noise in years, but it still raised his hackles.<br><br>&#x201c;What do I do? Where do I go?&#x201d; he asked as they all sprang to their feet. &#x201c;You guys are the only ones I&#x2019;ve seen.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;C&#x2019;mon with me,&#x201d; Orsatti said. &#x201c;Our shell jerker&#x2019;s got a bad back. I bet you can feed us ammo faster&#x2019;n him.&#x201d;<br><br>Pete hadn&#x2019;t said anything about his own injuries. He didn&#x2019;t say anything now, either. Instead, he followed Orsatti to a portside five-inch gun.<br><br>&#x201c;Step aside, Jonesy,&#x201d; Orsatti snapped to the private standing next to the ammunition hoist. &#x201c;We got a new guy here who ain&#x2019;t gonna keel over on us.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m okay, goddammit,&#x201d; Jonesy said.<br><br>&#x201c;Move,&#x201d; Orsatti told him, and the other Marine moved. Such was the power of two stripes.<br><br>Pete grabbed a shell and handed it to the loader. How much did it weigh? Fifty pounds? Seventy-five? He wasn&#x2019;t in anything like good hard shape. He&#x2019;d have to do the best he could&#x2014;that was all. He could hear planes overhead. The more they could knock down or scare off, the better.<br><br>The gun roared. The smaller antiaircraft guns were already stuttering out destruction. He seized the next shell and passed it on. Sweat was already springing out. Only dead men didn&#x2019;t sweat like pigs in the Philippines.<br><br>A plane with big red meatballs on the wings and fuselage plummeted into the harbor, trailing smoke and fire. The blast as its bombs exploded staggered Pete; water they kicked up drenched him. And a glistening metal fragment tore out Jonesy&#x2019;s throat. His cheers turned to horrible gobbling noises. He clutched at his neck with both hands, but blood sprayed and gushed all the same. His hands relaxed. He slumped to the deck. He couldn&#x2019;t hope to live, not with his head half cut off.<br><br>More bombs whistled down. In spite of blast and whining, screeching fragments&#x2014;in spite of almost literally being scared shitless&#x2014;Pete went on feeding the five-inch gun. Maybe the intense antiaircraft fire from the Boise did scare off some Japs. Maybe the light cruiser was just lucky. Any which way, she picked up a few new dents and dings, but no more. Some of the other gun crews also had men down, wounded or as dead as Jonesy. All the same, she remained a going concern.<br><br>Her skipper decided it was time for her to get going, too. As soon as the Japanese bombers droned off to the west&#x2014;back toward Jap-owned Formosa, Pete supposed&#x2014;he ordered the lines cast off and the gangplank raised. Then he took her out of the harbor as fast as she would go. Nobody aboard had a bad word or, Pete was sure, a bad thought about that. If she stayed where she was, odds were she wouldn&#x2019;t stay lucky a third time. All the old boring jokes about sitting ducks applied.<br><br>And Pete had more new buddies than Joe Orsatti. Go through a fight with a gun crew and you were all pals if you survived it. Jonesy&#x2014;his first name was Elijah&#x2014;went into the Pacific shrouded in cloth and weighed down by shell casings, along with half a dozen other dead men. The Boise raced south at upwards of thirty knots, looking for . . . Pete didn&#x2019;t exactly know what. Whatever it proved to be, he hoped he&#x2019;d come out the other side again.<br><br>January 20, 1941, was a miserable, frigid day in Philadelphia. Sleet made the roads anywhere from dangerous to impossible. Ice clung to power lines, too, and its weight brought some of them down.

I began considering the manuscript by injecting a few of my opinions into the mix. First and foremost, I sincerely believe sailing is easy. Many of the other books I'd seen seemed to try to make it more difficult by including lots of technical information. Cruising Fundamentals would do the opposite. It would take the moderately complicated elements of intermediate sailing and break them down into simple, descriptive terms. <p>I also wanted the material in the book to follow the logical path of a sailing course. Most intermediate sailing courses begin with simple material such as familiarizing students with the boat. They then progress toward the end of the course hitting some predictable milestones along the way. I believe Cruising Fundamentals has been organized in this manner. </p><p>My other primary objective was to keep it fun. In my opinion, it's a tragedy for people with a healthy curiosity about sailing to become overwhelmed by concerns it may be too complicated and technical. A sailing course shouldn't be presented like physics or engineering (no offense meant to physicists or engineers, but most people seeking recreation don't gravitate toward such subjects). You do it for fun so learning it should be equally fun. </p><p>Finally, I had the benefit of hundreds of students' and instructors' questions and difficulties with the material in the book. Reflecting on which topics caused the most problems and solutions I had found, allowed me to present the subject matter in what I believe is a clear, concise and effective manner. </p><p>I sincerely hope you like the book and that its lessons provide you with a lifetime of challenge, fun and excitement. </p><p>Harry Munns Marina del Rey, CA March, 1999</p><p>In Melville's 1850's classic, <i>Moby Dick</i>, he asked, "Why is almost every robust, healthy boy with a robust, healthy soul in him, at some time or other, crazy to go to sea? Why, upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land?" </p><p>Today the "robust, healthy souls" belong to men, women and children of all ages. And while much more is known about traveling under sail and the world's fascinating destinations, the sea's irresistible "mystical vibration" still draws thousands of modern-day adventurers to its shores, and beyond, every year. </p><p><i>Cruising Fundamentals</i> provides the tools necessary to make the transition from basic sailing to competent coastal cruising. Sailors interested in learning how to sail and live aboard a 30 foot to 50 foot auxiliary-powered sailboat will find a wealth of practical skills in this book, from simple instruction on plumbing, electrical, and mechanical systems to navigation, weather prediction, and anchoring techniques. </p><p><i>Cruising Fundamentals</i> is the official American Sailing Association guide to intermediate coastal cruising and bareboat chartering. Sailing schools, yacht clubs, and other educational institutions throughout North America use this book as a text and indispensable resource in their teaching. Unlike other books on similar subjects, <i>Cruising Fundamentals</i> presents material in a chronology that has proven effective with thousands of developing sailors. Readers progress from "Getting Acquainted" to "Getting Familiar," "The Voyage," "Arrival and Living Aboard," and finally "Emergencies and Trouble Shooting." Each of the first four sections has review questions to help sailors evaluate their comprehension. <i>Cruising Fundamentals</i> is more than a book; it is a complete course that can benefit any sailor who desires to enter the exciting world of sailboat cruising.</p></p><h2>The Boys Of My Youth</h2><p>Rarely does the debut of a new writer garner such attention &amp; acclaim. The excitement began the moment "The Fourth State of Matter," one of the fourteen extraordinary personal narratives in this book, appeared in the pages of the New Yorker. It increased when the author received a prestigious Whiting Foundation Award in November 1997, &amp; it continued as the hardcover edition of The Boys of My Youth sold out its first printing even before publication. The author writes with perfect pitch as she takes us through one woman's life--from childhood to marriage &amp; beyond--and memorably captures the collision of youthful longing &amp; the hard intransigences of time &amp; fate.</p><p>Jo Ann Beard beautifully evokes her childhood in the early '60s, a time in which mothers continued to smoke right up to labor, one's own scabs were deeply interesting, and Barbie dolls seemed to get naked of their own volition, knowing that Ken would be the one to get in trouble if they were caught. Beard's memories of the next 30 years are no less sharp and wry, powered by antic melancholy, perfect juxtapositions, and "the push of love." When she was little, "the words of grown-ups rarely made sense," and even now, with the exception of her best friend and a few colleagues, not much seems to have changed. <p> In the title story, Beard and her best friend, now 38, still spend forever on the phone, an activity they perfected in junior high and that is now possible thanks to an office WATS line. Hindsight easily renders their seventh-grade ex nihilo obsession with a "ninth grader extraordinaire" foolish, along with most encounters with the boys of their youth. But their current relations with men are really no less absurd, as they realize while listening to Beard's latest possibility leave an answering-machine message: "I don't know whether to faint or kill myself. Elizabeth laughs unbecomingly. I put both hands around my own neck. We are no longer bored." </p><p> <i>The Boys of My Youth</i> is filled with family picnics, small celebrations, and fragility. Beard knows that her teenage efforts to "have a better personality" were as futile as her later attempt at "practicing being snotty, in anticipation of being dumped by my husband," but that doesn't make her any less fond of her younger self. And she has the same affection, and irritation, for her family, who slowly emerge in story after story. In "Waiting," she and her older sister try to keep calm as their mother is dying: "I hold two fingers up to remind her of how much longer she needs to keep this up, to pay attention. She holds up one finger, guess which one, to remind me of who's the oldest, who's the boss. I would love more than anything to slap her." </p><p> There isn't a weak piece in this collection, which includes the world's most perfect description of the agonies of having your hair washed--at age 3--and the ecstasies of one encounter near the Mexican border. "The car is a boiling cauldron. The coyote stands scruffy and skittish, like a wild dingo dog I met once, who bit everything in sight, wagging his tail like a maniac. Eric slides the camera to me and puts a hand on my arm. He whispers in my ear. I nod. I love dogs better than anything else on earth, next to cigarettes and a couple of people." </p><p> Beard often edges from serious laughter to high seriousness and back again. "The Fourth State of Matter" is perhaps the book's standout, a narrative about space physicists; invading squirrels; a beautiful, dying dog; a "vanished husband"; and, alas, a seminar turned 12-minute massacre. On November 1, 1991, she leaves work early and passes by the disappointed graduate student who will later that day gun down eight members of the University of Iowa physics depart. Her piece is complex and heartbreaking, a master conduit of emotion and information. As always, Beard knows the rich value of the minor ritual. Earlier, she had recalled playing "Maserati" with her collie: "I'd grab her nose like a gearshift and put her through all the gears, firstsecondthirdfourth, until we were going a hundred miles an hour through town. She thought it was funny." After "the newslady" finally confirms her colleagues' deaths, "Maserati" again figures: "We sit by the tub. She lifts her long nose to my face and I take her muzzle and we move through the gears slowly; first second third fourth, all the way through town, until what has happened has happened and we know it has happened."</p><p><b>Jo Ann Beard</b> is the author of a collection of autobiographical essays, <i>The Boys of My Youth</i>.

Did Dudley&#39;s wife, Amy, die from an accidental fall in a deserted house, or was it murder? Even Dr. John Dee, astrologer royal, adviser on the Hidden and one of Dudley&#39;s oldest friends, is uncertain. Then a rash promise to the Queen sends him to his family&#39;s old home on the Welsh Border in pursuit of the Wigmore Shewstone, a crystal credited with supernatural properties. With Dee goes Robert Dudley, considered the most hated man in England. They travel with a London judge sent to try a sinister Welsh brigand with a legacy dating back to the Battle of Brynglas. After the battle, many of the English bodies were, according to legend, obscenely mutilated. Now, on the same haunted hill, another dead man has been found, similarly slashed. Devious politics, small-town corruption, twisted religion, and a brooding superstition leave John Dee isolated in the land of his father.</p><p><b>Phil Rickman</b>&nbsp;writes and presents the book program <i>Phil the Shelf</i> on BBC Radio Wales.

I am Jesus Christ; I came by the will of the Father, and I do his will.&#34; These words, spoken by the Savior in ancient and modern times, provide the challenge with which Elder Bruce R. McConkie of the Council of the Twelve Apostles, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, begins this four-volume work on the mortal life and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ. Who was Jesus of Nazareth? What was his mission? What do we know of his birth, his early life, and his ministry? Who were his disciples? What were the conditions in Palestine in the Meridian of Time, when he walked the earth and mingled with men? In his earlier work, The Promised Messiah, Elder McConkie discussed the prophecies concerning the Messiah. Now, in The Mortal Messiah, Book 1, he writes about how the prophecies were coming to pass as the Advent of the Messiah approached the conditions in Palestine and among the Jews at that time: the birth of the forerunner, John the Baptist, and of Jesus himself: his childhood; his baptism and early ministry.</p><p></p><h2>Amy Winehouse: The Biography 1983&#x2013;2011</h2><p><strong><p><strong>A detailed biography that pays tribute to the award-winning singer whose turbulent life and untimely death have captivated the world </strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong><strong></strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>An indisputable musical icon and controversial celebrity figure, Amy Winehouse's unique blend of jazz, pop, and soul singing and songwriting brought her a host of awards&#x2014;including two prestigious Ivor Novellos and five Grammys&#x2014;as well as an army of committed fans who adored her rich voice and painfully honest lyrics.

Her novels have won her high acclaim, and many have been chosen as ALA Best Books for Young Adults. She lives in North Carolina.My birthday is at the beginning of July.<br><br>I have always loved birthdays. I have a chain of birthday memories that run all the way back to the year I was three, although Dad insists that no one can remember that far. I got a doll for that birthday, she had real hair, not the painted kind, and was dressed in a ballet skirt, and when I took her out of the box I thought she was alive.<br><br>So, you see, I do remember.<br><br>Later there was a circus birthday when I saw my first elephant and ate my first cotton candy. And there was the bicycle birthday, and the tennis racket birthday, and when I was twelve there was the birthday that brought Trickle.<br><br>But this particular birthday, the one on which I turned sixteen, there was no air of festivity. This was my own fault, for my parents wanted to give me a party.<br><br>"Sixteen is such a special age," Mother kept saying. "Don't you want to invite some people to celebrate? Or if you'd prefer to have it just family, we could go out for dinner someplace nice and then maybe to a play."<br><br>"No," I told her. "I really don't feel like doing anything. I've outgrown that sort of thing."<br><br>The truth, of course, was that I would not share my birthday with Julia.<br><br><i>Julia.</i> Just the sound of her name was enough to make me feel slightly sick. When I heard my Mother speak it, her voice filled with warmth--"Julia, dear, you really must do some posing for me. It's a waste to have a beautiful niece and not to use her for a model"--my stomach churned.<br><br>"Julie," my father called her. Every time he saw her his face brightened, as though she were the second daughter he had always longed for.<br><br>I held myself apart from them all and watched, and it was a strange feeling, as though I were a visitor from another planet observing something of which I was no part. I watched Julia smiling at my father and calling him "Tom." I watched her helping Mother in the kitchen, moving deftly about with a pan or a dish towel, taking over chores that formerly were mine. I watched Bobby tease her into a game of dominos and saw Peter's eyes follow her about with a kind of hopeless adoration.<br><br>But worst of all was watching her with Mike. For the first time in my life I wished that he did not live next door to us, for it made it much too easy for him to wander over after work, for no special reason, to sit on the porch steps and chat. He was as nice to me as he always was--nicer, really--for he no longer tossed me playful insults or called me silly nicknames. He was politely formal and very kind.<br><br>"You look really nice today," he would say. "I like your hair like that," although my hair was no different from what it had always been, "Is that a new outfit?" when I was wearing the same tired pair of denim shorts and faded plaid shirt that I had worn all summer the year before.<br><br>But he was not kind enough to try to hide his reason for coming.<br><br>"Is Julia around?" he would ask avoiding my eyes. And Julia always was.<br><br>"You're not mad, are you, Rae?" she asked me. "It wasn't as though I could help it. These things do sometimes happen."<br><br>"You <i>made</i> it happen," I said bitterly. "You knew Mike was mine.<br><br>"He wasn't yours," Julia said in a reasonable way. "People don't own other people. You told me yourself the first day I was here that you weren't going steady. I didn't break anything up. Mike says you were just good friends, that you've always been like a little sister to him."<br><br>"That's not true." I tried to speak with dignity. "He may say that now, but he wouldn't have said it a month ago."<br><br>"Things change," Julia said with a shrug.<br><br>This could not be denied. Things did change, and the thing that seemed to have changed the most was Julia herself. When I think back now, it is hard for me to decide exactly whom to picture when I say the name "Julia." There were three Julias--all different. There was the Julia who arrived with my parents that first day, hesitant and frightened, the haunted, tight-faced girl who stood uncertainly in the doorway in the shadow of my father, and held out her hand to me and said, "Hello." Then there was the later Julia, relaxed and self-confident, the quaint touch of the hills gone from her speech. This was the Julia who plucked her eyebrows so that they no longer hung like bushes over her huge eyes and used my lip gloss to widen her mouth and make her thin lips fuller and warmer. This Julia laughed and chattered and used Albuquerque slang and went with Carolyn to the hair dressers' and had her thick mane cut and styled into a long shag.<br><br>"She's copied Carolyn," I remarked to Peter, who immediately bristled as though he had been personally insulted.<br><br>"You're jealous," he said. "You've turned into a real cat since Mike threw you over."<br><br>"Threw me overl" True though they were, the words cut me to the core. I could not believe that my brother had said them. "What about you? Do you feel thrown over?"<br><br>"I never went with Julia."<br><br>"But you would have if you could," I said cruelly. "You fell for her like a ton of bricks, and you know it. And you're not over it either."<br><br>"So?" Peter said. "That's why I understand how Mike feels about her. No guy in his right mind could help falling for a girl like Julia, and she's got a right to choose anybody she wants. It burns me up to hear you run her down just because she has something that you haven't."<br><br>"What is it she has?" I asked, really wanting to know. "What are the qualities that have you and Mike so enchanted?"<br><br>"I can't explain it," Peter said."It's just--something.&nbsp;&nbsp;A kind of feeling.&nbsp;&nbsp;A sort of--magic."&nbsp;&nbsp;And he blushed, embarrassed at having used a word that sounded so romantic."She's just--special somehow."</p><h2>Pierrepoint: A Family of Executioners: The Story of Britain&#39;s Infamous Hangmen</h2><p>For&nbsp;55 years, generations of the Pierrepoint family served as fearsome hangmen in England. The dynasty began in 1901 with Henry Pierrepoint,&nbsp;who&nbsp;was followed into the gruesome profession by his brother Thomas, and in time, his eldest son Albert. Between them, they carried out an amazing 900 executions. This book recounts the lives and tales of the Pierrepoint family, their reasons for taking up the profession, and the inside details of the execution cases and the deeds themselves. Insight is shed on the feuds and intense rivalry between fellow hangmen, as well as the notorious cases that kept the family firmly in the spotlight. With extracts from diaries and comments on the family's representation in the media, this book provides a fascinating look at a profession that is long gone, but certainly not forgotten.</p><p><b>Steve Fielding</b> is the author of several historical crime titles such as <i>The Hangman's Record</i> and <i>The Murder Casebook Series</i>.

Many of his books have also been cited as Outstanding Trade Books for Children by the National Science Teachers Association.Grade 7 Up An account of the fantabulous adult years of Grizzly Adams, chiefly in the Sierra Nevadas of California. The intrepid Adams was known as a trapper and a tamer of the largest of bears as well as of other carnivors; a hunter for meat to feed his managerie, his men, Indians, emigrants and miners; and a showman, both on his own, and in the last year of his life, with P. T. Barnum in New York. Adams' activities were so extraordinary that they read as if created expressly to be the substance of dime novels. What else could one make of a man who for many years was companion to a female grizzly bear, Lady Washington, with whom on frigid nights he slept? Yet one must not overlook that as a hunter and collector of animals, Adams was also a businessman, selling furs, meat and live specimens. Readers who are unfamiliar with the geography of the West will be able to follow Adams' travels on the maps included; reproductions of contemporary illustrations add visual information and ambiance to the text. Readers who favor rough and ready adventures so rare that they seem to be exaggerations will read and reread this biography.

Karen Mains says, "Yes!" And in <em>Open Heart, Open Home</em> she shows how. In this classic on Christian hospitality, Karen Mains steps far beyond how-to-entertain hints to explore a biblical and spiritual approach to using your home to care for others. This approach to hospitality can literally transform the fabric of your community and your world. If you labor under the illusion that hospitality requires Martha Stewart-like abilities, then Mains will free you from a load of guilt! Instead, she offers fresh and inspiring ideas for using your own resources to serve rather than to impress with new "opening the door" activities in each chapter. You will discover how the Holy Spirit can work in and through you to make others feel welcome and wanted. Whether you are a business executive or a homemaker, a professional minister or a layperson, a seasoned entertainer or an entertaining klutz, you will find here the encouragement and skills you need to reach out with the gospel through daily acts of acceptance, belonging and love.</p><p>"I'm so glad this book is coming back into print. . . .

It helped me to see our home as a real instrument of ministry, not as a showplace for furniture."

She is also the director of Hungry Souls, a ministry designed to teach Christians how to establish self-directed spiritual growth.

Her IVP titles include <em>The God Hunt</em> and <em>Open Heart, Open Home</em>.</p><h2>Apples from the Desert: Selected Stories (The Helen Rose Scheuer Jewish Women&#39;s Series)</h2><p>Savyon Liebrecht's intense, lyrical, and emotionally complex stories have made her a best-selling writer in her native Israel. Her short fiction explores the everyday tragedies that emanate from strained relationships between Arabs and Jews, women and men, older and younger generations in present-day Israel. According to the <em>Washington Post Book World</em>, her "engrossing and skillful tales take you through the lives of real people, to the heart of their emotional and moral being." Liebrecht reveals the impact of larger social and political conflicts within the private world of the home with a precision and a subtle ferocity reminiscent of the work of Nadine Gordimer. "These finely wrought stories of private lives shed light on a terrifying political conflict", notes the <em>New York Times Book Review</em>. "[Liebrecht] takes you places you've never been before." <em>The Helen Rose Scheuer Jewish Woman's Series</em></p><p>"Months afterwards she would remember that morning with dismay, when she had sat with them for the first time, as though they were at home there: drinking from cups like welcome guests ... and only the part of her, the part that didn't laugh with them, thought: Could these hands, serving coffee, be the ones that planted the booby-trapped doll at the gate of the religious school at the end of the street?" <p> In the stories of Israeli author Savyon Liebrecht, personal relationships can't help but become political. In "A Room on the Roof," an unnamed Jewish woman hires three Arab workers to build an addition onto her house while her husband is out of the country. So paralyzed is she by her fear of <i>Arabs</i>, she is unable to recognize the essential decency of these particular men; on the rare occasions when she <i>is</i> able to see past her own blind bigotry, the realization that her workmen are human beings with their own set of hopes, fears, and prejudices is so terrifying that she becomes even more strident in her intolerance. </p><p> Though a few of the stories in <i>Apples from the Desert</i> are directly concerned with interactions between Jews and Arabs, the collection is, in fact, more about how Israelis deal with each other. The Holocaust is the unmentioned elephant in the drawing room, for Liebrecht, herself the daughter of concentration camp survivors, is particularly interested in the impact that tragedy has had on the children of survivors. In "Hayuta's Engagement Party," everyone fears that Grandpa, a Holocaust survivor, will ruin this festive occasion (as he has many others) with his grim recitals of death-camp atrocities. The protagonist of "'What Am I Speaking, Chinese?' She Said to Him" returns to her childhood home in Poland in order to stage a sexual encounter in the same room where her parents--again Holocaust survivors--once argued about sex. </p><p> If the Holocaust is one theme running through most of these stories, the position of women in modern Israeli society is another. Many of the women--especially older ones--in Liebrecht's stories are in oppressive marriages with men who neglect, ridicule, and sometimes physically abuse them. In "Compassion," a Jewish woman who was hidden from the Nazis in a Catholic convent as a child marries an Arab man who eventually imprisons her and takes a younger wife. Victoria, the mother of a rebellious daughter in the collection's title story, only recognizes the depths of her own marital misery when she sees the loving relationship her child has formed outside the legal bonds of matrimony. </p><p> There is nothing subtle about Liebrecht's stories, and readers accustomed to the finely tuned ironies of an Ann Beattie or Alice Munro may find these stories a trifle emphatic. However, anyone interested in the literature coming out of Israel today will find Savyon Liebrecht's window on the land and the people illuminating, if sometimes uncomfortable reading.</p>Grace Paley is a cooperative anarchist and combative pacifist.

For instance, he shows that in some cases a situation he calls 'Zugzwang Lite' can arise, where White finds himself lacking any constructive moves. He also takes a close look at the theories of two players who, in differing styles, have specialized in championing Black's cause: Mihai Suba and Andras Adorjan.

In the war-torn twentieth century, we rarely hear that one of the main costs of armed conflict is long-term loss of liberty to winners and losers alike. Beyond the obvious and direct costs of dead and wounded soldiers, there is the lifetime struggle of veterans to live with their nightmares and their injuries; the hidden economic costs of inflation, debts, and taxes; and more generally the damages caused to our culture, our morality, and to civilization at large. The new edition is now available in paperback, with a number of new essays. It represents a large-scale collective effort to pierce the veils of myth and propaganda to reveal the true costs of war, above all, the cost to liberty.</p> <p> Central to this volume are the views of Ludwig von Mises on war and foreign policy. Mises argued that war, along with colonialism and imperialism, is the greatest enemy of freedom and prosperity, and that peace throughout the world cannot be achieved until the central governments of the major nations become limited in scope and power. In the spirit of these theorems by Mises, the contributors to this volume consider the costs of war generally and assess specific corrosive effects of major American wars since the Revolution. The first section includes chapters on the theoretical and institutional dimensions of the relationship between war and society, including conscription, infringements on freedom, the military as an engine of social change, war and literature, and the right of citizens to bear arms. The second group includes reconsiderations of Lincoln and Churchill, an analysis of the anti-interventionist idea in American politics, a discussion of the meaning of the "just war," an assessment of how World War I changed the course of Western civilization, and finally two eyewitness accounts of the true horrors of actual combat by veterans of World War II. <i>The Costs of War</i> is unique in its combination of historical scope and timeliness for current debates about foreign policy and military intervention. It will be of interest to historians, political scientists, economists, and sociologists.</p></p><p><p> <em>John V.

Meddling, miserable and small-minded, she is the Scrooge of the Bath Square where she lives. Her neighbors are weary of her constant allegations - the latest being that someone is stealing her plants. When Joanna McKenzie, ex-policewoman turned private detective, is called to investigate the horticultural happenings, she finds she doesn't care for Mrs. Pyrce either - but a minor source of unpleasantness turns major when Mrs. Pyrce is battered to death and all leads point to Joanna.<br>If this was not challenging enough, she is forced to work alongside her former colleague and old flame, Chief Inspector James Carrick. The heat begins to build on all fronts when a young redheaded nurse, mistaken for Joanna, winds up murdered, and the eccentric characters living in Bath Square begin to show their true colors. Joanna and James must put their feelings on hold and unite to catch the killer before their time runs out in Margaret Duffy's sparkling introduction to a new pair of sleuths.</p><p>How can the loss of the Chantbury Pyx, a priceless reliquary stolen from a Bath gallery, be related to the murder of Mrs. Pryce, a vicious old biddy whose complaint to Lance Tyler's private inquiry agency about flowers purloined from her garden makes it all too easy for Tyler's partner, Joanna Mackenzie, to identify her when she's struck down with a hammer? Inspector James Carrick, Joanna's former superior officer and former lover (she lost her CID job over the affair), is thunderstruck by the possibility that the same hammer may have been used in both crimes. He's struck in other, more dramatic ways as well: After a brutal attack in her home leaves Mackenzie nearly dead, Carrick, returning to the flat to check the windows, ends up joining her in sick bay. Which of Mrs. Pryce's neighbors--the sweet-toothed agoraphobe with a biker boyfriend, the boorish fan of raucous modern music, the nursing home matron whose cats have a high accident rate, the army veteran subject to blackouts, or Carrick's own retired schoolmistress--can be responsible for a series of felonies ranging from stolen flowers and poisoned cats to murder? Duffy (Who Killed Cock Robin?, 1990, etc.) etches her unlovely characters so sharply that it's a shame the plot keeps snatching you away from them just as you're getting nicely acquainted. Plucky, angry Mackenzie in particular would be well worth a sequel. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The community assumed the Steele marriage was ideal, but the investigation disclosed that the judge had been having a long affair and that he was considering a divorce. The case remained unsolved until FBI field agent Ressler was assigned to Cleveland in 1971. Here, with the aid of Shachtman ( The Day America Crashed ), he relates his successful investigation; Steele had arranged his wife's murder through his client Owen Kilbane, a pimp, and Owen's brother Martin. The actual shooter was one Rickey Robbins, who turned state's evidence, whereupon Steele and the Kilbanes were found guilty in 1977 and sentenced to life.

Not down a sleepy residential street like McLean. If it had just turned in from Route 79&#x2014;known in Freehold, New Jersey, as South Street&#x2014;it would have been going even more slowly, since no seven-ton truck could round a 90-degree corner at a fast clip. But the truck had the height and breadth to all but fill the side road and sweep the other cars, bikes, and pedestrians to the side until it grumbled past. Assuming the other folks were paying attention to the road ahead.<br> <br>The five-year-old girl on the tricycle had other things on her mind. She might have been racing her friend to the Lewis Oil gas station on the corner. Or maybe she was simply a child at play, feeling the spring in the air on a late afternoon in April 1927.<br> <br>Either way, Virginia Springsteen didn&#x2019;t see the truck coming. If she heard the driver&#x2019;s panicked honk when she veered into the road, she didn&#x2019;t have time to react. The driver stomped hard on the brakes, but by then it didn&#x2019;t matter. He heard, and felt, a terrible thump. Alerted by the screams of the neighbors, the girl&#x2019;s parents rushed outside and found their little daughter unconscious but still breathing, They rushed her first to the office of Dr. George G. Reynolds, then to Long Branch Hospital, more than thirty minutes east of Freehold. And that&#x2019;s where Virginia Springsteen died.<br> <br>The mourning began immediately. Family members, friends, and neighbors streamed to the little house on Randolph Street to comfort the girl&#x2019;s parents. Fred Springsteen, a twenty-seven-year-old technician at the Freehold Electrical Shop downtown, kept his hands in his pockets and spoke quietly. But his twenty-eight-year-old wife, Alice, could not contain herself. Hair frazzled and eyes veined by grief, she sat helplessly as her body clutched with sobs. She could barely look at Virginia&#x2019;s toddler brother, Douglas. The boy&#x2019;s father couldn&#x2019;t be much help either, given the pall of his own mourning and the overwhelming needs of his distraught wife. So in the immediate aftermath of the tragedy virtually all of the care and feeding of the twenty-month-old boy fell to Alice&#x2019;s sisters, Anna and Jane. Eventually the others eased back into their ordinary lives. But the approach and passing of summer did nothing to ease Alice&#x2019;s grief.<br> <br>She could take no comfort in the clutching arms of her small son. Nearing his second birthday in August the boy grew dirty and scrawny enough to require an intervention. Alice&#x2019;s sisters came to gather his clothes, crib, and toys and took the toddler to live with his aunt Jane Cashion and her family until his parents were well enough to care for him again. Two to three years passed before Alice and Fred asked to be reunited with their son. He went home soon afterward, but Virginia&#x2019;s spirit continued to hover in Alice&#x2019;s vision. When Alice gazed at her son, she always seemed to be seeing something else; the absence of the one thing she had loved the most and lost so heedlessly.<br> <br>A semblance of family structure restored, the Springsteen home still ran according to its residents&#x2019; imprecise sense of reality. No longer employed by the Freehold Electrical Shop, Fred worked at home, sifting through mountains of abandoned electronics in order to repair or build radios he would later sell to the migrant farmworkers camped on the fringe of town. Alice, who never worked, moved according to her internal currents. If she didn&#x2019;t feel like getting up in the morning, she didn&#x2019;t. If Doug didn&#x2019;t want to go to school in the morning, she let him stay in bed. Cleaning and home repair ceased to be priorities. The walls shed curls of paint. The plastered kitchen ceiling fell off in chunks. With a single kerosene burner to heat the entire house, winters inside were Siberian. For Douglas, whose DNA came richly entwined with darker threads, the peeling wallpaper and crumbling windowsills framed his growing sense of life and the world. No matter where he was, no matter what he was doing, he would always be looking out through the fractured windows of 87 Randolph Street.<br> <br>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�<br> <br>Doug Springsteen grew to be a shy but spirited teenager matriculating at Freehold High School. He loved baseball, especially when he was with his first cousin and best friend, Dave &#x201c;Dim&#x201d; Cashion, an ace pitcher and first baseman. Cashion was already considered one of the best players to ever emerge from Freehold. Off the diamond, the cousins passed the hours shooting pool at the small game rooms tucked between the stores, barbershops, and news stores clustering Freehold&#x2019;s central intersection at South and Main Streets. Cashion, who was seven years Doug&#x2019;s senior, launched his baseball career just after leaving school in 1936. He spent the next five years working his way from the local amateur and semipro leagues all the way into the major league farm system. He got there just in time for World War II to shutter the leagues and redirect him into the US Army.<br> <br>Raised by parents for whom education amounted to a long distraction from real life, Doug quit his studies at Freehold Regional after his freshman year ended in 1941, taking an entry-level job as a bottom-rung laborer (his official title was creel boy) in Freehold&#x2019;s thriving Karagheusian rug mill. He kept that job until June 1943, when his eighteenth birthday made him eligible to join the army. Shipped to Europe in the midst of the war, Doug drove an equipment truck. Back in Freehold following the war&#x2019;s conclusion in 1945, Doug took it easy and lived off the $20 in veteran&#x2019;s pay he received from the government each month.<br> <br>As Fred and Alice made clear, academic and professional ambition were not priorities, if only because of their absolute disinterest in achievement&#x2014;to say nothing of books, culture, or anything that gestured beyond the here-and-now. So if Doug wanted to live in their house and slouch through his life, that suited them perfectly. He was, after all, his parents&#x2019; child.<br> <br>Doug barely made a gesture toward adult life until his cousin Ann Cashion (Dim&#x2019;s younger sister) came by offering a night out. She had a friend named Adele Zerilli he might like to meet. So how about a double date? Doug shrugged and said sure. A few nights later the foursome were sitting in a cafe together, making polite talk while Doug snuck glances at the bewitchingly talkative dark-haired girl sitting across the table. &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t get rid of him after that,&#x201d; Adele says now. &#x201c;Then he says he wants to marry me. I said, &#x2018;You don&#x2019;t have a job!&#x2019; He said &#x2018;Well, if you marry me, I&#x2019;ll get a job.&#x2019;&nbsp;&#x201d; She shakes her head and laughs.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, God. What I got into after that.&#x201d;<br> <br>Married on February 22, 1947, Douglas and Adele Springsteen rented a small apartment in the Jerseyville neighborhood on the eastern edge of Freehold and experienced the postwar boom along with much of America. True to his word, Doug had landed a job on the factory floor of the Ford auto plant in nearby Edison. Adele already had a full-time job as a secretary for a real estate lawyer. A baby was on the way by the start of 1949, and the boy emerged at 10:50 p.m. on the evening of September 23, taking his first breath in Long Branch Hospital (since renamed Monmouth Medical Center), where his father&#x2019;s sister had breathed her last twenty-two years earlier. He had brown hair and brown eyes, weighed in at 6.6 pounds, and was declared healthy in every respect. His twenty-four-year-old parents named him Bruce Frederick Springsteen and though they had their own home, instructed the nurse to write into the birth certificate that their home address in Freehold was 87 Randolph Street.<br> <br>When his wife and child were discharged from the hospital a week later, Doug took them to his parents&#x2019; house and handed little Bruce to his mother. She held him close, cooing gently at the first new life that had entered their home since the long ago death of Virginia. When Alice peered into his eyes, her own tired face came alight. Almost as if she were seeing the glimmer that had once glowed from inside her own lost daughter. She clutched the boy to herself and for the longest time would not let him go.<br> <br>She must have loved you to pieces, Bruce heard someone say not long ago. He laughed darkly. &#x201c;To pieces,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;would be correct.&#x201d;<br> <br>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�<br> <br>Spending his first months in his parents&#x2019; small apartment, Bruce ate, slept, stirred, and cried like every other baby. And yet the blood in his veins carried traces of forebears whose lives describe American history going all the way back to the early seventeenth century, when Casper Springsteen and wife Geertje left Holland to build their future in the New World. Casper didn&#x2019;t survive very long,1 but a son who had remained in Holland followed in 1652, and Joosten Springsteen launched generations of Springsteens, including a branch that drifted to the farmlands of Monmouth County, New Jersey, at some point in the mid-eighteenth century. After the Revolutionary War broke out in 1775, John Springsteen left his farm to serve as a private in the Monmouth County militia, fighting multiple battles during a three-year hitch that ended in 1779. Alexander Springsteen, also of Monmouth County, joined the Union army in 1862, serving as a private with the New Jersey Infantry until the end of the Civil War in 1865. Throughout, and into the twentieth century, the Springsteens worked as farm laborers and, with the growth of industrialization in Freehold, factory workers.<br> <br>Alice Springsteen&#x2019;s family were Irish immigrants from Kildare who came to America in 1850, settling in the farmlands of Monmouth County, where they worked the fields and, in some cases, pushed their families up another rung or two on the economic ladder. Christopher Garrity, the patriarch of the family, sent for his wife and children in 1853. His daughter Ann met a neighbor, a laborer named John Fitzgibbon, soon after and married him in 1856. Two years later he invested the $127.50 it took to buy a family home at 87 Mulberry Street2, a street in a growing neighborhood of working-class homes just south of Freehold&#x2019;s center. Ann Garrity marked their place by planting a beech tree seedling she had brought to America from Kildare. The tree flourished, as did Ann and John Fitzgibbon, who had two children in the years before John went to serve in the Civil War. As a sergeant in the Union army, John earned a chest full of ribbons for his courage on the battlefields of Fredericksburg and Charlottesville, Virginia, then returned home to father another seven children before dying in 1872. Remarried to a shoemaker named Patrick Farrell, Ann delivered a set of twins, including a girl named Jennie, whose own daughter, Alice, eventually married a young electronics worker named Fred Springsteen.<br> <br>If only every member of the family could have grown as straight and strong as Ann Garrity&#x2019;s beech tree. But as fate and genetics must have it, both sides of Fred and Alice Springsteen&#x2019;s lineage came with a shadow history of fractured souls. The drinkers and the failures, the wild-eyed, the ones who crumbled inside of themselves until they vanished altogether. These were the relatives who lived in rooms you didn&#x2019;t enter. Their stories were the ones that mustn&#x2019;t be told. They inspired the silence that both secreted and concentrated the poison in the family blood. Doug could already sense the venom creeping within himself. Which may have had something to do with why he had fallen so deeply for Adele Zerilli, whose indomitable spirit would protect and nurture him for the rest of his life.<br> <br>The youngest of the three daughters born to Anthony and Adelina, Italian immigrants who had arrived as teenagers (separately) at Ellis Island during the first years of the twentieth century, Adele spent her childhood in the Bay Ridge neighborhood at the southern tip of Brooklyn. The family&#x2019;s luxe home came courtesy of Anthony, who had learned English on the fly and quickly earned his American citizenship and a law school degree. Taking a job in a law firm his uncle had founded to specialize in real estate, investments, and the like, Anthony&#x2019;s bluster grew along with the firm&#x2019;s success in the 1920s. Short but broad chested, possessed of a big voice, stylish wardrobe, and charisma to match, the thriving attorney moved through the world like a weather front, altering the barometric pressure of any room he entered. Adelina, on the other hand, pursued the life of an old-fashioned Italian lady, wearing traditional dresses, surrounding herself with reminders of the Old World, and refusing to utter more than a small handful of English words even as her daughters grew to be modern American girls.<br> <br>When the Depression hit in 1929, Anthony wished he could go back in time, too. Reduced to moving his family into an apartment, he borrowed some of his remaining clients&#x2019; cash to keep his own investments afloat. Then he borrowed more. Then he borrowed too much. Meanwhile, Anthony had other indulgences, too, including an affair with a secretary who eventually claimed his heart. Anthony&#x2019;s marriage ended first, and then the federal agents came knocking. &#x201c;I guess the word is embezzlement,&#x201d; Adele says.<br> <br>Then the word was convicted, then sentenced. And as Anthony prepared to spend a few years away, he bought an inexpensive old farmhouse on sixty acres near the edge of Freehold and had it fixed up so his family could live as comfortably, if inexpensively, as possible while he did his bit in the grim caverns of Sing Sing prison. Only by then, Adelina&#x2019;s broken marriage and abrupt financial descent had unstrung the observant Catholic so thoroughly that she decided to let her daughters make their own household while she took refuge with relatives. Told to provide for her younger sisters, the recent high school grad Dora took a job as a waitress and kept her sisters on a short leash. Weekly visits from an aunt who always came bearing a suitcase full of spaghetti and tinned tuna helped make ends meet. The girls could also count on the help of the man their father had introduced as George Washington, an African-American day laborer he hired to serve as his daughters&#x2019; chauffeur and handyman. And though his name wasn&#x2019;t really George Washington (that was apparently Anthony&#x2019;s invention), and he was a grown man in his thirties, he became a regular presence in the home. &#x201c;All we knew about him was that he could dance,&#x201d; Adele says. According to middle sister Eda, the action heated up at seven o&#x2019;clock when the nightly Your Hit Parade came on the radio. That&#x2019;s when they turned up the volume, pulled aside the living room rug, and kicked up their heels. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s when we learned how to dance,&#x201d; she continues. &#x201c;It sounds crazy, I know, but that&#x2019;s how it went.&#x201d; The vision makes Adele&#x2019;s son laugh out loud. &#x201c;They used to go to the balls, and the soldiers were on leave, and they went to dance, dance, dance,&#x201d; Bruce says. &#x201c;They had it all going on.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dora and Eda had sided with their mother in the divorce, while Adele was officially neutral but sympathetic enough to heed her father&#x2019;s request to accompany his girlfriend on the journey to Ossining, New York, so she would have the right to participate in Sing Sing&#x2019;s family visiting hours. When Dora got wind of her sister&#x2019;s jailhouse visits, she filed papers with the Monmouth County courts to bring it to a stop. And when Anthony convinced Adele to join his beloved secretary on another trip anyway, Dora had her sister put on probation. &#x201c;It was stupid, because I was a baby!&#x201d; Adele says. So she must have been terribly aggrieved...</p><h2>Bolton and Wodehouse and Kern: The Men Who Made Musical Comedy</h2><p>This Wonderful, Informational, and Historical Book: Bolton and Wodehouse and Kern by Lee Davis is about America Musical Theatre. Bolton and Wodehouse and Kern is more than history, it&#39;s a re-creation of the lives and times of three of the American Musical Theatre&#39;s most and fascinating men. In this star-studded, anecdote-sprinkled journey through the widely divergent lives of the trio that began it all.</p><p>The 1915 Broadway show Nobody Home , by composer Jerome Kern and librettist Guy Bolton, was the first American musical to treat music, lyrics and book as equal components; Oklahoma! (1943) added dance to the formula. So contends Davis, a playwright, theater historian and Long Island University lecturer, in a triple biography that wondrously re-creates the heady enchantment of Broadway's musical theater in the teens, '20s and '30s. Joining the Kern-Bolton team in late 1915 was P. G. Wodehouse, English novelist and humorist, then a Vanity Fair drama critic. Over the next five years, the trio collaborated on several sophisticated musical comedies, and their paths and fates would cross constantly. Generously quoting stage dialogue and lyrics, and drawing on interviews with the likes of Ira Gershwin, Myrna Loy, Fred Astaire and Sir John Gielgud, Davis brings critical acumen and a raconteur's gifts to a star-studded narrative. It restores Bolton (1882-1979), who worked in New York, Hollywood and London, to his rightful place in theater history. Davis challenges conventional wisdom on many points, such as the popular belief that the Bolton-Wodehouse script for the Cole Porter musical Anything Goes was rewritten by Howard Lindsay and Russell Crouse because of the plot's similarity to the tragic fire at sea of the liner Morro Castle. The real reason for the rewrite, he shows, was the producer's dislike of the first script's satire on Hollywood, plus the messy complexity of the second Bolton-Wodehouse version. Davis also scrutinizes Wodehouse's notorious shortwave broadcasts made during his year-long imprisonment by the Nazi who captured him in France in 1940. Intended to reassure fans that his captors were treating him well, Wodehouse's jocular broadcasts resulted in his being branded a traitor and his books getting banned in Britain, where he never returned. Davis, defending Wodehouse against his critics, faults the humorist for naive, foolish misjudgment, suggesting he was duped by the Germans.

Marry, in blowing him down again, with the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational increase, and there was never virgin got till virginity was first lost. That you were made of is mettle to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost may be ten times found. By being ever kept, it is ever lost. 'Tis too cold a companion.

To speak on the part of virginity is to accuse your mothers, which is most infallible disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin: virginity murders itself and should be buried in highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites, much like a cheese, consumes itself to the very paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach. Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the canon. Keep it not, you cannot choose but lose by't. Out with't! Within ten year it will make itself two, which is a goodly increase, and the principal itself not much the worse. Away with't!<br><br>HELEN How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?<br><br>PAROLLES Let me see. Marry, ill, to like him that ne'er it likes. 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with lying: the longer kept, the less worth. Off with't while 'tis vendible. Answer the time of request. Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out of fashion: richly suited but unsuitable, just like the brooch and the toothpick, which wear not now. Your date is better in your pie and your porridge than in your cheek. And your virginity, your old virginity, is like one of our French withered pears: it looks ill, it eats dryly.

The resolution of this paradox leads Fingarette to fundamental insights into the mind at work. He questions our basic ideas of self and the unconscious, personal responsibility, and our ethical categories of guilt and innocence. Fingarette applies these ideas to the philosophies of Sartre and Kierkegaard, as well as to Freud's psychoanalytic theories and to contemporary research into neurosurgery. Included in this new edition, Fingarette's most recent essay, "Self-Deception Needs No Explaining" (1998), challenges the ideas in the extant literature.</p><p>"Fingarette's book on the topic is so firmly and deservedly entrenched it is 'essential reading.'"&#x2015;Roger Squires, Editor, <i>The Philosophical Quarterly</i><br><br>"It was Herbert Fingarette, in his book <i>Self-Deception,</i> who made the theme of self-identity central in thinking about self-deception. . . . Quite simply, it is the most important single work on the topic. It is a classic that merits staying in print for many years to come." Mike W. Martin, author of <i>Self-Deception and Self-Understanding</i><br><br>"Since 1962 our writings on self-deception have been largely directed at the two philosophers who are to be thanked most justly and warmly for keeping interest in self-deception alive: Professor Herbert Fingarette of the University of Cailfomia, Santa Barbara, and the late Jean-Paul Sartre." &#x2015;John King-Farlow and Richard Bosley<br><br>"The best treatment of self-deception I know to date remains that of Herbert Fingarette in <i>Self-Deception."</i>&#x2015;Ronald B. deSousa, Professor of Philosophy, University of Toronto<br><br>"A classic." &#x2015;Robert C.

In 1845, Frederick Douglass, a black American slave, lands in Ireland to champion ideas of democracy and freedom, only to find a famine unfurling around him. In 1919, two brave young airmen emerge from the carnage of World War I to pilot the first transatlantic flight from St. John&#x2019;s, Newfoundland, to the west of Ireland. And in 1998 an American senator criss-crosses the ocean in search of a lasting peace in Ireland.</p><p>Taking these stories as his point of departure, Colum McCann weaves together the lives of Douglass, Alcock and Brown and Senator George Mitchell in a tapestry that is both ambitious and unforgettable.</p></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, June 2013: </strong>McCann&#x2019;s stunning sixth novel is a brilliant tribute to his loamy, lyrical and complicated Irish homeland, and an ode to the ties that, across time and space, bind Ireland and America. The book begins with three transatlantic crossings, each a novella within a novel: Frederick Douglas&#x2019;s 1845 visit to Ireland; the 1919 flight of British aviators Alcock and Brown; and former US senator George Mitchell&#x2019;s 1998 attempt to mediate peace in Northern Ireland. McCann then loops back to 1863 to launch the saga of the women we&#x2019;ve briefly met throughout Book One, beginning with Irish housemaid Lily Duggan, whose bold escape from her troubled homeland cracks open the world for her daughter and granddaughter. The language is lush, urgent, chiseled and precise; sometimes languid, sometimes kinetic. At times, it reads like poetry, or a dream. Choppy sentences. Two-word declaratives. Arranged into stunning, jagged tableaux. Bleak, yet hopeful. (Describing Lily&#x2019;s first view of America: &#x201c;New York appeared like a cough of blood.&#x201d;) The finale is a melancholy set piece that ties it all together--an unopened letter, &#x201c;passed from daughter to daughter, and through a succession of lives,&#x201d; becomes the book&#x2019;s mysterious token, an emblem of a world grown smaller. McCann reminds us that life is hard, and it is a wonder, and there is hope. --<em>Neal Thompson</em><p><strong>COLUM McCANN</strong> is the internationally bestselling author of seven novels and three collections of stories.

Anne Perry lives in Scotland.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>This 1981 mystery, the fourth in the long-running series featuring Inspector Thomas Pitt and his well-born wife, Charlotte, is one of the best for its balance between the mystery itself and Perry's scathing portrait of Victorian society. It is bad enough that the recently deceased Lord Fitzroy-Hammond has been removed from his grave, but when it happens a second time and then other buried corpses start popping up, the normally unflappable Pitt is puzzled indeed. Is the perpetrator trying to hide a murder or call attention to one? The answer lies in a convoluted but perfectly logical merging of art, blackmail, politics, pornography, and prostitution. Perry (Paragon Walk) delights in showing how much of London, except for a handful of influential citizens, chose to ignore the shameful poverty surrounding them. This provocative tale, extremely well read by Davina Porter, is highly recommended for popular collections.

From her beginnings as a reporter with CBS and the Financial Times to her work for Time magazine and her most recent appointment with the Irish Times in Paris and Washington, this collection of new and selected in-depth pieces is full of the insight and reflection we have come to expect from the veteran reporter. <br><br>Featuring a lengthy introduction on the nature of the correspondent&#x2019;s work and charting her own career, this debut publication includes lengthy articles selected by Lara herself &#x2013; including several that were suppressed or quashed by certain publications &#x2013; notably in the case of a long piece charting three generations of a Palestinian family from 1948 onwards, which Time magazine would ultimately quash. Her work has brought her to war zones in the Middle East, Afghanistan and the Balkans, and she lived for several years in Beirut working for Time. <br><br>Irish readers are most familiar with her recent spell as the Paris-based correspondent for the Irish Times and the book features some of her best writing from that posting, including a wonderful portrait of Carla Bruni, whom she met in the singer&#x2019;s private Paris residence.

Recent evictions of long-time San Francisco residents, outrageous rents and home prices, and blockaded "Google buses" are only the tip of the iceberg. James Tracy's book focuses on the long arc of displacement over almost two decades of "dot com" boom and bust, offering the necessary perspective to analyze the latest urban horrors.</p><p>A housing activist in the Bay Area since before Google existed, Tracy puts the hardships of the working poor and middle class front and center. These essays explore the battle for urban space&#x2014;public housing residents fighting austerity, militant housing takeovers, the vagaries of federal and state housing policy, as well as showdowns against gentrification in the Mission District.

He partied with Elsa Maxwell. He ate snails with the French writer Colette, in bed. It was all, as he often said, "perfectly delightful."</p><p>Few more colorful figures embellish American cultural history than the late Harvey S. Ladew, wealthy socialite, fox hunter, artist, traveler, and -- at his country estate outside Baltimore -- creator of the nation's most admired topiary garden.</p><p>In "Perfectly Delightful": The Life and Gardens of Harvey Ladew, Christopher Weeks offers an immensely readable, chatty account of Ladew's life and the glittering world he inhabited. When Ladew bought his Maryland farm in 1929, he had already lived a life few, if any, could equal: born into the upper stratum of New York society in 1887, he spoke French before he spoke English and took boyhood drawing lessons from Met curators. As an adult he gave decorating instructions to Billy Baldwin (the dean of American interior design), lived as the houseguest of the maharajah of Kapurthala, took a camel caravan across Arabia (with travel tips kindly provided by his good friend T. E. Lawrence), weekended at the stateliest of England's stately homes, lent his favorite horse to the Prince of Wales, matched wits with Edna Ferber, No�l Coward, Sacheverell Sitwell, Beatrice Lillie, and Dorothy Parker (in English) and with Jean Cocteau and Colette (in French), hunted fox in America, England, Ireland, and Italy, and (with Charlie Chaplin) saw off Gertrude Lawrence as she sailed from New York.</p><p>To this fascinating story of multicontinental revelry, Weeks attentively adds the background and development of Ladew's unique and wonderful Maryland garden, which attracts thousands of visitors each year, and his important role as an early environmentalist. When he began his garden in 1929, Ladew broke new artistic ground, for he was perhaps the first person in America to follow the tenets of English arts and crafts garden design. His achievements were featured in Town &amp; Country, House &amp; Garden, (and its French counterpart, Maison et Jardin), Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, the Washington Post, and the New York Times. Garden clubs and gardening tourists from four continents strove to outdo one another in praise. This acclaim culminated in 1971, when the Garden Club of America gave Ladew its Distinguished Achievement Award.</p><p>To bring readers the remarkable story of Ladew and his gardens, Christopher Weeks draws on photo albums, scrapbooks, garden catalogs, thousands of pages of garden memoranda, an unfinished hand-scrawled autobiography, hundreds of letters, and guestbooks that read like a cross between Variety and Burke's Peerage. Photographs reproduced from Ladew's albums -- some taken by him, some by leading photographers of the day, including many by his friend Horst -- illustrate the text. Scores of interviews with Ladew's friends from New York to Florida help to illuminate this remarkable personality.</p></p><p><p>Wealthy, talented, surrounded by a glittering circle of friends, Harvey Ladew was much more than the maker of Maryland's famous topiary garden.</p><p>An architectural historian, Christopher Weeks serves on the consulting committee of the Ladew Topiary Gardens, the foundation Harvey Ladew established to care for his unique creation. Weeks has written or edited a dozen books on architecture and gardening and contributes frequently to periodicals such as the Green Scene, American Heritage and Country Life, Harvey Ladew's favorite magazine.</p></p><h2>Let Ministry Teach: A Guide to Theological Reflection (From the Interfaith Sexual Trauma Institute)</h2><p><p>Relating theology to the practice of ministry is one of the most elusive goals in pastoral training. Drawing upon seventeen years of experience in theology, Doctor Kinast describes a step-by-step approach to help students and experienced ministers learn what their ministry teaches. Through examples, practical suggestions, and principles grounded in process theology, readers of <i>Let Ministry Teach</i> explore the full range of resources needed for meaningful theological reflection.</p> <p><i>Let Ministry Teach</i> strikes a clear balance between a very broad and detailed presentation of a theological reflection method so that it is neither too simplistic nor too hard to handle. Each chapter describes a fundamental step in the method with the help of an illustration and commentary. Chapters conclude with a list of practical suggestions and a short description of the theoretical background and its main points.</p> <p>The challenge of theological reflection is to keep theology in the authentic experience of God's presence in our midst. <i>Let Ministry Teach</i> places this reflection in context: in a small group - where it works best; as a meaningful experience - one that has an impact, and initiates discussion; as a faith-theological perspective reflecting on experience from many points of view; as a practical outcome where a person is in a better position to guide events according to one's beliefs; and as a continuous process - a skill which must be practiced.</p> <p>In <i>Let Ministry Teach</i>, Doctor Kinast develops a successful way of <i>doing</i> theological reflection, which includes: selecting an experience - focusing on the meaningful moments; describing an experience - making it available for reflection; entering an experience - learning what it has to teach; learning from an experience - grasping what it teaches by relating it to what a person already knows and what the experience suggests is yet to be learned, and enacting the learning - incorporating the learning into a pattern of living and theological reflection.</p> <p>The true basis of theological reflection - a full, deep, meaningful embrace of life - is learned from one's own experience. Respectful of the full range of theological resources available for reflection, and mindful of the primary goal of recognizing God's presence and responding to it, theological reflection weaves experience and theology together into a way of life that continues the journey begun when Jesus first appeared.<i> Let Ministry Teach </i>is offered as a companion for those on that journey.</p> <p><i>Robert L.

Annotation c. by Book News, Inc., Portland, Or.</p><p>Photographer Kathleen Jo Ryan first witnessed the awe-inspiring spectacle of the Grand Canyon in 1987. A year later she rafted the Colorado River into the canyon, emerging from this transforming experience with the idea for a book: "Going down the river into the heart of the canyon is adventuring into a place of spirit. I hold a warm, overwhelming feeling of gratitude, respect, and humility for having been allowed to float and play through this majestic canyon." In <i>Writing Down the River</i> Ryan shares her gratitude by inviting women writers to venture down the Colorado and contribute their "personal journeys." Gretel Ehrlich provides context--historical, geographic, and biographical--in the foreword, and 15 other writers join the celebration with their individual voices.<p> Sharman Apt Russell, author of <i>When the Land Was Young: Reflections on American Archaeology</i>, describes her initial peek: "My heart starts beating fast when I first see the Grand Canyon, looking down from the South Rim, the vertigo of too much space. My bones feel hollow, like a bird's bones." Annick Smith, editor of <i>The Last Best Place: A Montana Anthology</i>, writes about the roar of the rapids: "Then comes the fifth wave. We climb up and up, stroking hard, but we do not cut through. The wave grows. It's a demon curling above us. Its foaming dragon breath is distinct as a Japanese painting, alive. Now I am stroking air." Judith Freeman, author of <i>A Desert of Pure Feeling</i>, writes of the lingering aftereffects: "For many nights after I left the river I awoke in darkness with the feeling I was still in the canyon. I sat up suddenly in strange beds, in desert motels and distant cities, certain that I was still sleeping on a rock ledge or a spit of sand."</p><p> Ryan's photographs of rock, water, and sky round out this evocative portrait of a place unlike any in the world. Taken as a whole, <i>Writing Down the River</i> is a collection of personal reflections as well as a tribute to the unifying power of landscape.</p></p><h2>Diana Scheunemann</h2><p>Photographer Diana Scheunemann has shot high-fashion advertising with gorgeous, statuesque models and she has shot sexually frank pictures of her friends (who look like gorgeous, statuesque models), but here's the real artistry: she manages to pull it off so that a sense of play rather than envy or lust or exploitation is paramount. Scheunemann is not interested in the mopey model pout. Her subjects enjoy their romps in the buff, clearly at ease with her camera. The sex is real but hardly titillating (well, maybe a little). Her work resembles a more polished version of her fellow countryman Wolfgang Tillmans's photographs of his friends--spontaneous, open and real. This book is part of the new series called <i>Damiani Forward</i>, focusing on new, up and coming photographers.</p><p></p><h2>Whispers of Warning (A Change of Fortune Mystery)</h2><p><b>Ruby Proulx&#x2019;s new life in Orchard Beach, Maine, faces some sinister complications in the next Change of Fortune Mystery by Jessica Estevao...<br></b><br>Free from the clutches of her con artist father, Ruby Proulx is starting to settle in at the Belden, her aunt Honoria&#x2019;s seaside hotel.

In my experience, crowds of people composed of some filled with hope and others with skepticism create the same impression, no matter the subject of the gathering. Even the setting was similar. A steady breeze flapped canvas tents that ringed the border of the campground&#x2019;s natural amphitheater. I felt oddly at home and deeply uncomfortable all at the same time.</p><p>As I headed for the seat my aunt Honoria had reserved for me near the front I met Officer Lewis from the Old Orchard Police Department.</p><p>&#x201c;I am pleased to see you support a woman&#x2019;s right to vote, Officer,&#x201d; I said, giving him a bright smile. &#x201c;Not everyone is so enlightened.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure if I support it or not. I&#x2019;m on duty this evening.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;On duty?&#x201d; I wondered if something had occurred to warrant police attention. &#x201c;Surely there&#x2019;s no cause for concern when a group of politically minded women gather together to promote equality?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Rallies like these can easily get out of hand. Emotions tend to run high on the matter of suffrage.&#x201d; Officer Lewis bent toward me. &#x201c;Sometimes it&#x2019;s the ladies who are the most unruly.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What is it that they do to get into so much trouble?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;Do they speak their minds? Wear bloomers? Smoke cigars?&#x201d; Officer Lewis blushed to the roots of his hair. He shook his head and stammered.</p><p>&#x201c;They chain themselves to fences and use language I haven&#x2019;t even heard the local fishermen use,&#x201d; Officer Lewis said.</p><p>&#x201c;Some of them even have been known to hit men over the head with their parasols,&#x201d; said a deep voice in back of me. I turned around to see Officer Warren Yancey standing directly behind me.</p><p>&#x201c;I understand the urge,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Although I think it rather ungentlemanly for you to remind me of past sufferings.&#x201d; Officer Yancey and I had met a few weeks earlier when a passing pickpocket had targeted me as soon as I had alighted from the train in Old Orchard. Since my purse had contained all my worldly goods, save the clothes on my back and my trusty parasol, I had used the latter to drive him off. In the course of doing so I had managed to fall and strike my head on the pavement. Officer Yancey considered himself to be my rescuer. I was convinced the credit for that stayed with me.</p><p>&#x201c;Have you a place to sit?&#x201d; he asked me. &#x201c;They are already stopping people at the gate and asking them to listen as best they can from the outside.&#x201d; Officer Yancey was right. Every bench was filled and people stood along the back.</p><p>&#x201c;My aunt is holding a seat for me near the front. I&#x2019;d better join her.&#x201d; I gestured to a spot near the stage where Honoria had turned around and was beckoning me.</p><p>&#x201c;Just be sure to mind your fetching hat when the rotted fruit starts flying.&#x201d; He tipped his own cap at me as he took his leave. I hurried to where Honoria awaited me, all the while sneaking peeks at the other attendees for signs of produce. I settled myself just as a hush descended over the crowd and Sophronia Foster Eldridge took the stage. A cheer of welcome went up from the crowd and then the amphitheater quieted again as she motioned with her hands for the noise to stop.</p><p>Sophronia was one of the country&#x2019;s most renowned suffragist leaders, one who used her abilities as a psychic medium to channel messages of equality from beyond the veil. Which is precisely why she reserved rooms at the Belden for her visit to Old Orchard. My aunt had realized some time ago that her modest hotel could not compete with the grandeur offered by the neighboring competition in our seaside community.</p><p>Like the savvy businesswoman she was, my aunt decided the only way to remain solvent was to create a niche for herself in the market. Honoria, who was a dedicated Spiritualist, decided to staff her establishment with paranormal practitioners and offer readings and development opportunities to spiritually inclined guests.</p><p>So far the venture was proving profitable and the arrival of Sophronia was expected to help make it even more so. In fact, Sophronia&#x2019;s choice of the Belden as her base in Old Orchard was a magnificent peacock plume in Honoria&#x2019;s straw bonnet. We found ourselves completely booked for the rest of the summer as a result of her stay.</p><p>Even though she was a guest at Honoria&#x2019;s hotel I had yet to lay eyes on her. A delay in her train&#x2019;s arrival had necessitated her heading straight from the station to the amphitheater. Honoria and I had had to content ourselves with welcoming her steamer trunks and valises. I could tell from her upright posture Honoria was even more eager than I for her first glance of our famous guest. She had nearly exhausted herself, not to mention the hotel staff, over the last few days ensuring every detail was in readiness for Sophronia&#x2019;s arrival.</p><p>Sophronia stepped into the center of the stage. Her severe black gown highlighted the pallor of her cheeks and gave her an otherworldly appearance. Despite her ephemeral appearance her voice projected across the natural amphitheater with ease. Honoria leaned forward like an eager child. I felt a thrill of anticipation run across my stomach as I awaited her message.</p><p>&#x201c;I am gratified to see that so many of you have turned out today in support of enfranchisement for women.&#x201d; Sophronia&#x2019;s cheeks pinked as she warmed to her subject. &#x201c;I am here this day to encourage you to imagine a world where women not only have the right to vote in elections but are in fact a great force which shines their uniquely moral outlook on those in public office.&#x201d; All around me voices began to murmur in agreement.</p><p>&#x201c;No longer shall those in power abuse their positions without exposure, without consequence. Men have used the argument that we women are too noble, too pure, to sully ourselves by becoming involved in the moral morass that is politics.&#x201d; The murmurs grew and Miss Foster Eldridge raised her hands for quiet once more. &#x201c;I say the world of politics is shockingly in need of a dose of purity, or nobility. The very traits men fear are too delicate to survive the rough-and-tumble shenanigans of the world beyond the hearth and home are the ones most needed to guide our nation.&#x201d;</p><p>She paused and looked out across the crowd. Her compelling gaze landed on several different points. My heart gave a little lurch and I found I was glad that gaze had not fixed on me. There was something about her that made me feel like she could see straight into the subject of her attention.</p><p>&#x201c;For too many years such reasons to keep us at arm&#x2019;s length have been offered. The quest for the vote has been slow and by no means steady. Year after year we gather and rally and ask for our due. And what have we accomplished of late? Very little, if you ask me.&#x201d; Sophronia swept an accusing finger across the crowd. &#x201c;Men of corrupt character freely and routinely hold positions of power in every branch of industry as well as government. For some time now I have received visions and messages from my spirit guide concerning secret dealings and corruption of all sorts and I have been urged by that same spirit to bring those dark deeds before the public. I have nearly finished compiling these messages into a manuscript. When it is finished I fully intend to offer it to the highest publishing bidder. Not only will the world be forced to consider the consequences of men and their misuse of power but I will be in possession of a tidy sum to be used to fund further suffrage efforts.&#x201d;</p><p>The murmurs swelled to a roar. All around me the amphitheater buzzed with noise and rustling as people turned in excitement to those around them. The din pressed against my head like the sound of an oncoming train. There was an uneasy feeling in the atmosphere and I felt the sudden urge to flee. I looked back over my shoulder at the exit, which seemed much farther away than it had when I entered.</p><p>Honoria seemed to sense my concern and she placed a reassuring hand on my forearm. I felt my shoulders unclench. Honoria was a dedicated suffragist with a great deal of experience at such rallies. If she noticed no cause for alarm I would trust there was nothing of concern about to transpire.</p><p>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t possibly expect anyone will give credence to rumors you say you&#x2019;ve received from a disembodied spirit?&#x201d; A man stood in the row and shouted at Sophronia. &#x201c;The notion is entirely ludicrous, even for a woman. If you have any sense of decorum you will quit the stage at once and save us all from more of these outrageous remarks.&#x201d; Beside him a small woman in a white summer dress sat gazing up at him with what I interpreted to be a look of adoration upon her face. The man looked familiar but I could not say I had ever before seen him in person. I wondered if I had seen a photograph of him in the newspapers. He had the unchecked self-assurance of a man used to effortlessly getting his own way.</p><p>As if on cue Sophronia&#x2019;s head lolled forward. The noise of the crowd cut off as if their voices had been snatched from their throats by an unseen force. She raised her head again and a voice entirely unlike her own rattled up from her chest and out from between her lips. Her eyes remained closed and she swayed slightly back and forth. Her hand lifted and she stretched a slim finger in the direction of her heckler.</p><p>&#x201c;Your confidence is misplaced. Repent or you will be harried and castigated. You will be thwarted at home and afield.&#x201d; Sophronia&#x2019;s voice cackled and she raised her other hand and pointed it at him as well. &#x201c;You will be brought low by your past and cut off from your future. Change your ways before it is too late.&#x201d; Sophronia&#x2019;s voice tapered off at the end and her arms dropped to her sides. A woman from the wings rushed to her and supported her by wrapping a capable arm around her waist.</p><p>Before Sophronia&#x2019;s eyes opened the man began once more to shout. &#x201c;How dare you threaten me? You are nothing more than a charlatan and a harlot.&#x201d; Another roar went up from the crowd and all around me people surged to their feet. I was about to stand myself when I felt Honoria&#x2019;s restraining hand on my arm.</p><p>&#x201c;Best to stay put. When Nelson Plaisted begins a tirade there will likely be projectiles.&#x201d; She inclined her head in the direction of the man who had raised his voice to Sophronia. &#x201c;I suggest we take cover before the onslaught begins.&#x201d; With that, Honoria reached below the bench in front of us and retrieved an umbrella, which she deftly popped open above our heads. I pressed myself under its sheltering canopy just in time to hear something land on the waxed canvas above me.</p><p>&#x201c;You know his name?&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Of course I do,&#x201d; Honoria shook her head and exhaled deeply. &#x201c;That odious fellow is Congressman Nelson Plaisted. I rather suspect he&#x2019;s here running for reelection.&#x201d;</p><p></p><br><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>There were few things Yancey disliked more than disbanding unruly crowds. Especially those comprised mostly of women. Even more especially when the crowd contained his sister. His mood was not improved by the inclusion in the fray of Miss Honoria Belden and her niece, the irrepressible Miss Proulx.</p><p>Fruit had, as he had predicted, been flung, but he was relieved to note as he caught sight of Miss Proulx that none of it clung to her hat or any part of her costume. As she passed nearby, her hair tumbling out of its pins and framing her face in damp curls Yancey&#x2019;s heart gave a tight tug at the sight of her. That was until she approached and began to speak.</p><p>&#x201c;There was no cause for you to insist on dispersing the crowd. If I wasn&#x2019;t inclined to give you the benefit of the doubt I&#x2019;d be forced to think you did not want women to have a public forum for progress.&#x201d; Miss Proulx&#x2019;s hands had crept onto her hips and her words pelted out of her like rock salt from a shotgun. Yancey felt like a crow in a cornfield.</p><p>&#x201c;Protecting the citizenry is part of my job. I will rely on my own judgment as to how best to perform that duty,&#x201d; Yancey said. He was irritated to note he felt the unwelcome familiar heat at the back of his neck he generally experienced when interacting with Miss Proulx.</p><p>&#x201c;But that&#x2019;s exactly why we are here. Without the right to vote we cannot truly be considered citizens.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Citizens or not, I doubt those pelted with spoilt produce were unhappy with my decision to clear the amphitheater.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No one was hurt.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But they would have been if we hadn&#x2019;t insisted on disassembly. Rocks would have been flying through the air next. The meeting had become passionately overheated.&#x201d; Yancey felt he could be speaking for himself as much as for those involved more directly in the meeting. There was just something about Miss Proulx that set his nerves jangling. Not for the first time, he wished her far from his presence so he could better concentrate on the matters at hand. Before he could extract himself from her absorbing company she spoke again.</p><p>&#x201c;I would have thought an experienced police officer such as yourself would not have been so easily rattled. It was just a handful of wizened apples and an onion or two,&#x201d; Miss Proulx said. Yancey could hardly believe what he was hearing. Of all the unreasonable attitudes.</p><p>&#x201c;Have you ever witnessed the unbridled power of a mob?&#x201d; Yancey asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Would it surprise you to hear I have been in the very thick of riots on more than one occasion?&#x201d; Miss Proulx tipped her head back to better look him in the eye. Upon a closer inspection of her face he spotted a streak of what looked like strawberry pulp marring the smooth complexion of her right cheek.</p><p>&#x201c;Miss Proulx, it would not surprise me in the least to hear that not only were you in the very heart of many a mob but that you were in fact the cause of every one of them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I see we understand each other completely.&#x201d; With that, Miss Proulx turned her back and flounced away.</p><p>&#x201c;Miss Proulx is a remarkable young woman.&#x201d; Yancey turned to see Thomas Lydale standing nearby. &#x201c;And while I am in accord with her opinions concerning the vote for women, I can&#x2019;t agree with her about breaking up the assembly. From what I caught on film, things were getting ugly, fast.&#x201d; Thomas patted the front of his jacket and leaned in, lowering his voice.</p><p>&#x201c;Trying out a new detective camera?&#x201d; Warren asked. Thomas owned a photographic studio on Old Orchard Street, across from the police station, where he spent most days paying the bills by taking souvenir photographs of rich socialites and their families. But his real passion was candid shots of ordinary people going about their normal lives. He claimed people behaved differently as soon as they knew they were being photographed, or even if they knew a camera was in the area. He used a variety of hidden cameras to get the most natural results.</p><p>&#x201c;I am indeed. I ordered this one from a Sears and Roebuck catalogue. It came in the post a couple of days ago.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And you thought this rally was a good place to test it out?&#x201d; Yancey looked around at the overturned benches and a cluster of flies settling on a bruised pear.</p><p>&#x201c;Someday, when women have finally gotten the right to vote events like this rally will be historically significant. I ma...</p></p><h2>A collector&#39;s guide to peasant silver buttons</h2><p>Peasant silver buttons are the kind that are worn with traditional costume.

Lindsey lives in New Hampshire with her family.<b><p></p></b><p><b>Prologue</b><i></i></p><p><i>1808, England</i></p><p>They met at dawn. It was a narrow opening in the trees, just off the forest path, but a well-known spot nonetheless. An old rock there, partially hidden in the brush, nearly two feet round, was reputed to mark the site of some ancient battle. It was now known as The Dueling Rock.</p><p>At least seven duels were verified to have taken place there over the years, many more were mere rumors. There were other places in the south of England, of course, for men to settle their differences, but none quite so renowned as The Dueling Rock. Men even came from as far away as London to satisfy their honor at this site in Kent.</p><p>Sebastian Townshend and his best friend Giles had explored the area as children, fascinated, as boys will be, by tales of honor and bloodshed. They were neighbors and had grown up together as their estates bordered each other. The Dueling Rock was located in the forest north of their homes.</p><p>It was the natural place for Giles to name for them to meet, just after Sebastian had said to him, "My God, you married a whore?"</p><p>Giles had socked him, and rightly so. Sebastian shouldn't have been so blunt. His only excuse was that he'd been in shock. But then he'd just found out he'd unwittingly slept with Giles's new wife.</p><p>How the devil was he to have known? The woman shouldn't have been at that soir�e in London -- alone. She shouldn't have given the impression that she was available, introducing herself by only her first name, Juliette. But she had done more than that. She'd flirted outrageously with him and hinted they should meet to get better acquainted. Sebastian had been delighted. She was lovely, a new face, a sophisticated woman who knew what she wanted and obviously went after it. He was pleased to oblige her. Not once, by her actions, did he guess that she was married.</p><p>That quick marriage had been a rash move on Giles's part. So unlike him. He had a fianc�e at the time, a lovely English heiress, Eleanor Landor. So he'd been hesitant to break the news to his father, was keeping his new bride in London until he could figure out a way to explain her. She shouldn't have been at that soir�e, alone, without her husband.</p><p>Giles had come to Sebastian's home to make his accusation. His new wife, in her apparent guilt over the matter, had tearfully confessed everything to him. She'd put the blame entirely on Sebastian, even swore that he'd seduced her, when that hadn't been the case at all. And Giles, in his fury, wouldn't listen to Sebastian's account of it.</p><p>"The Dueling Rock, at dawn," Giles said before he stormed out of the house.</p><p>The accusations had been delivered in the entry hall of Edgewood, the Townshend ancestral home, the moment Sebastian came downstairs. Unfortunately, Sebastian's father, Douglas, had been drawn from his study by the shouts and had heard most of it. He wasn't angry. His disappointment in his oldest son and heir was apparent, though, and that cut Sebastian deep. He couldn't recall a single time in his life that he'd ever given his father a reason to be ashamed of him -- until now.</p><p>Douglas Townshend, eighth earl of Edgewood, had settled into marriage at an early age and was now only forty-three. Tall, with black hair and amber eyes, he was a handsome man who frustrated the local matchmakers because he had refused to remarry after his wife died.</p><p>He'd bequeathed his handsome visage and impressive height to his two sons, Sebastian and Denton. A year apart in age, with Sebastian being the older at twenty-two, the brothers should have got along splendidly, but that wasn't the case. Sebastian was much closer to his friend Giles Wemyss than he'd ever been to Denton. Not that he didn't love his brother. But Denton had a jealous nature that he'd long since given up trying to conceal. It had grown over the years, until now he was a bitter young man driven to excesses in drink due to his resentment that he'd never wear a title other than lord, simply because he was a second son. Unlike Sebastian, Denton had often gained their father's disapproval.</p><p>Douglas sighed now. "I will assume you didn't know this woman was Giles's wife."</p><p>"Good God, no one knew he'd married while he and Denton were touring France. Denton didn't know, or he was sworn to secrecy, because he said nothing about it when I went to London to welcome them home. And Giles didn't tell me, hasn't even told his family yet. He's obviously kept her secretly in London since he returned to England, probably to give him time to break off with his fianc�e before she hears of it. I didn't know the woman was married, Father, to anyone, least of all to my best friend."</p><p>"But you did make love to her?"</p><p>Sebastian flushed, wished to hell he could deny it, but couldn't. "Yes."</p><p>"Then go after him, explain your part in this, make amends however you must. But you will not meet him in the morning. I forbid it. He's not some passing acquaintance. You two have been inseparable since you were children, just as Cecil and I have been. And he's Cecil's only son."</p><p>Sebastian had every intention of doing just that, and not just because he loved Giles like a brother. His father said it aptly just before he left to find Giles.</p><p>"I know you, Sebastian. You wouldn't be able to live with yourself if you harmed him."</p><p>Unfortunately, the harm had already been done. There was nothing that could undo it or explain it away. Sebastian realized that clearly as the day wore on and he agonized over how to make amends to his friend. His explanations did nothing but enrage Giles more. He was in no state of mind to listen. Whether he believed Sebastian or not, it still came down to the simple fact that however unintentionally, Sebastian had slept with his wife.</p><p>Dawn barely lightened the sky the following morning. The rain had started several hours earlier and continued, with no sign of letting up. Sebastian's second, Theodore Pulley, was hopeful the duel would be canceled because of it. He was only an impartial acquaintance, but he was behaving as if he'd melt if the rain didn't stop soon. Actually, it was the accompanying thunder that made him so jumpy.</p><p>Sebastian said nothing in response to the man's nervous chatter. He was numb. Over the long, sleepless hours of the night, he'd decided what he had to do, the only thing he could do to redeem himself. It wouldn't be the first time a man had gone to a duel with the intention of dying.</p><p>Giles was late. Theodore was suggesting they leave when Giles and his second arrived. Sebastian didn't recognize the fourth man, who was acting as Giles's second.</p><p>"Couldn't find the bloody path in the rain," Giles explained.</p><p>Theodore still wanted to get out of the rain sooner rather than later and put the suggestion to the late comers. "Ought to cancel this, don't you think? Wait for a clear morning?"</p><p>"At this time of year?" the other second countered with a slight indistinguishable accent. "When is there ever a clear morning?"</p><p>"We duel now or I murder him," was Giles's clipped response.</p><p>So much for hoping a night's sleep might have dredged up some forgiveness, or at least the realization that Sebastian hadn't wronged him intentionally. But Giles appeared to be just as angry as he had been the day before.</p><p>Theodore coughed and said, "Quite right. We'll keep it sporting, then."</p><p>Giles's pistols were brought to Sebastian for inspection. He waved the man away. His own pistols were taken to Giles for the same. His friend seemed interested only in making sure the chambers were loaded. Sebastian was aware that Giles knew he didn't want to kill him.</p><p>"Prepare yourselves, gentlemen."</p><p>They stood back-to-back, shouldn't have spoken, but Sebastian's remorse was torn from him with the simple words, "I'm sorry."</p><p>Giles said nothing, giving no indication that he'd heard him. Instructions were given, the count begun. The rain hadn't let up, nor had the thunder, which boomed every few minutes, but the sun had risen enough to spread a gray gloom through the trees. It was enough light to see by, enough light to kill by.</p><p>They paced off the required steps, each man holding his chosen pistol in his hand, pointed at the ground. The count was continued, then the call to turn, take aim...</p><p>Sebastian stood with his gun pointed toward the sky, intending to fire the obligatory shot anywhere but at Giles. But Giles fired the very second it was called to do so, nicking Sebastian under his arm just as he was pulling his own trigger. Giles was a good shot; he should have done better than this at such close range. The wound he delivered was minor, but it brought Sebastian's arm down in an involuntary reaction. His bullet fired, the sound echoing through the trees along with another crack of thunder. It should have been wildly off the mark, but instead it landed at the dead center of Giles's chest.</p><p>Sebastian watched as his friend dropped to the ground. The look of surprise on Giles's face as he crumbled would forever haunt Sebastian. Shock kept him rooted to the spot while Giles's second bent down to examine him, then looked toward Sebastian and shook his head.</p><p>"I will inform his father," he said. "I assume you will inform yours."</p><p>Beside him, Theodore said, "You weren't going to fire at him, were you? What changed your mind?" He paused, seeing the blood under Sebastian's arm. "Ah, so that's why. What bloody rotten luck, eh? Or rather phenomenal luck, depending how you look at it."</p><p>Sebastian didn't answer, hadn't really heard him. It was impossible to describe what he felt in that moment of realization that he'd killed his best friend. Grief, horror, rage -- it was all there choking him. And guilt, so strong it took root in his heart and would never let go. And he still had to tell his father that he'd defied him, that his plan to exonerate himself with his own death had backfired.</p><p>Sebastian should have died there at The Dueling Rock that cold, gloomy morning. As far as he was concerned, he did.Copyright � 2005 by Johanna Lindsey</p></p><h2>It&#39;s on the Tip of My Tongue: Word-Finding Strategies to Remember Names and Words You Often Forget</h2><p>Have you ever known a word but cannot find it?

But he also shines a light on Elizabeth's rich private life, revealing a love for her craft and a loyalty to the underdog that fueled her lifelong battle against the studio system. Swathed in mink, disposing of husbands but keeping the diamonds&#x2014;this is Elizabeth Taylor as she lived and loved, breaking and making the rules in the game of supreme celebrity.</p></p><p><b>Product Description</b><br> In the 60s, Elizabeth Taylor's affair with the married Richard Burton knocked John Glenn's orbit of the moon off front pages nationwide. Yet, despite all the gossip, the larger-than-life personality and influence of this very human woman has never been captured. William Mann, praised by Gore Vidal, Patricia Bosworth, and Gerald Clarke for <i>Kate</i>, uses untapped sources and conversations to show how she ignited the sexual revolution with her on-and off-screen passions, helped kick down the studio system by taking control of her own career, and practically invented the big business of celebrity star-making. With unputdownable storytelling he tells the full truth without losing Taylor's magic, daring, or wit. <p></p><p>Readers will feel they are sitting next to Taylor as she rises at MGM, survives a marriage engineered for publicity, feuds with Hedda Hopper and Mr. Mayer, wins Oscars, endures tragedy, juggles Eddie Fisher, Richard Burton and her country's conservative values. But it is the private Elizabeth that will surprise--a woman of heart and loyalty, who defends underdogs, a savvy professional whose anger at the studio's treatment of her led to a lifelong battle against that very system. All the Elizabeth's are here, finally reconciled and seen against the exciting years of her greatest spirit, beauty, and influence. Swathed in mink, staring us down with her lavender eyes, disposing of husbands but keeping the diamonds, here is Elizabeth Taylor as she was meant to be, leading her epic life on her own terms, playing the game of supreme stardom at which she remains, to this day, unmatched.<br> <br> </p> <br> <p><b>A Q&amp;A with William J. Mann, Author of <i>How to Be a Movie Star</i></b><br> </p><p></p> <b>Q:</b> There have been more books on Elizabeth Taylor than just about any other star in Hollywood. Why do we need another one?<p></p> <b>A:</b> As entertaining as some of those books have been, none has really explored how she did it--how she created the culture of celebrity that we have today. Elizabeth Taylor really invented the modern enterprise of fame. Everyone from Madonna to Britney to Miley Cyrus is taking a page from her book.<p></p> <b>Q:</b> How were you able to chart this phenomenon?<p></p> <b>A:</b> It's helpful to understand how Hollywood works. Publicists and press agents would like us to think everything is spontaneous and real. Hey, those two stars making a movie together just happened to fall in love on the set! That it also provides a publicity bonanza is completely separate. There was no coordination, no manipulation. At least that's what they'd like us to think.<p></p> <b>Q:</b> Was that true for Taylor then? Were her legendary romances all manufactured for how they'd play in the press?<p></p> <b>A:</b> Not at all. Elizabeth was and is a passionate, independent woman. She always believed in what she was doing. For example, I chronicle the frantic press coverage and feverish public interest in her first marriage, when she was just 18, to Nicky Hilton--who, incidentally, was Paris Hilton's granduncle. As a romantic teenager, Elizabeth was gung-ho about making the marriage work--no matter that MGM was stage-managing the whole thing. They pushed this innocent girl into a marriage that turned out to be abusive and traumatic for her all so they could publicize a film, <i>Father of the Bride</i>, which was timed to come out at the same time. So Elizabeth was a movie bride at the same time as she was a real-life bride, but real life had far more dire consequences.<p></p> <b>Q:</b> So that must have been an early lesson for her in star-making, albeit a very difficult one.<p></p> <b>A:</b> Certainly she learned early on how the game was played. But what's wonderful about Elizabeth is that she never became jaded or cynical or dishonest. In fact, I think she's one of the most authentic stars ever to come out of Hollywood. She never lied to the public the way other stars did. But previous biographies have limited their approach to simply chronicling her passionate heart--without taking into account how these romances and marriages and scandals actually benefited her career. She really did fall in love with Eddie Fisher and Richard Burton while they were married to other women. But that didn't mean she and those around her didn't understand just how advantageous the headlines could be for Elizabeth.<p></p> <b>Q:</b> But it's always been said that the scandals with Fisher and Burton threatened to end her career, that the studios worried the public would turn its back on such a "scarlet woman."<p></p> <b>A:</b> That's just the spin. That's what they had to say. It was the old conventional wisdom. But Elizabeth is actually a very important figure in terms of celebrity culture. More than anyone else, she bridges the divide between Old Hollywood and New Hollywood. Old Hollywood, represented by the studios and conservative columnists like Hedda Hopper, expected the scandals to destroy Elizabeth. Indeed, they did their best to make sure she was penalized. But Elizabeth, who was being advised by a new breed of canny publicists and agents, knew that in this emerging Hollywood, there really was no such thing anymore as bad publicity.<p></p> <b>Q:</b> She was pretty damn famous, wasn't she? Far more famous than anything we have today, like Britney and Paris and the rest?<p></p> <b>A:</b> Absolutely. Especially in the 1950s and 1960s, when everything she did made headlines. Husbands, romances, movies, health crises, diamonds. John Glenn was making his historic orbit of the Earth but many newspapers still went with the Taylor-Burton scandal in Rome as their top story.<p></p> <b>Q:</b> And this then became the norm for celebrity culture? It changed the concept of "news."<p></p> <b>A:</b> Exactly. In the past, serious publications wouldn't lower themselves to cover movie stars. But suddenly there were editorials about Elizabeth Taylor all across the country. She was an enormous cultural influence. She showed that one could still be famous outside of the old studio structure by engaging her own team of personal managers and press agents. As a child and teenaged star, she learned all those valuable lessons at MGM. Then she took what she had learned and made it work for her on her own. And turned out to be an even bigger star outside the studio than she was before.<p></p> <b>Q:</b> Was she a better actress or a better movie star?<p></p> <b>A:</b> I think Elizabeth would acknowledge that she excelled more often as "movie star" than she did as "actress." But she could really be damn good at times. Here's something that sets her apart from these modern-day stars who, whether they know it or not, are following her playbook. Elizabeth understood that fame is an exchange with the public. For every headline there needed to be a good movie. You had to give something back. She never simply coasted on her fame. Instead, she turned in some truly outstanding performances in <i>A Place in the Sun</i>, <i>Giant</i>, <i>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</i>, and <i>Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf</i>--there are others, but those are her four best, in my opinion.<p></p> <b>Q:</b> She's known for so many health crises. There was the time she almost died in London and the whole world watched and waited for news. How true was all that?<p></p> <b>A:</b> Everything's true with Elizabeth. Whether or not she was as critical as she and those around her claimed, there's no doubting the sincerity of the experience for her. But even still, that shouldn't discount just how brilliant she and her publicists were in using that experience to her advantage. A year before, in the wake of the Fisher scandal, she had been tarred as Hollywood's home-wrecker. Now she was hailed as Lazarus back from the grave. In the book, I document the fascinating process of how this particular episode played out in the press and then climaxed with her winning her first Academy Award. It's a perfect illustration of the book's title:<i>How to Be a Movie Star</i>.<p></p> <b>Q:</b> So you're saying that Elizabeth Taylor was far more shrewd than we've been led to believe.<p></p> <b>A:</b> Absolutely. Far, far more shrewd. You know, "smart" has never been the first word that comes to mind when we think of Elizabeth Taylor. Glamorous, beautiful, alluring, sure. But in fact she was perhaps the smartest of all the old stars in knowing how to both maintain her fame and preserve a real private life as well. She didn't sacrifice personal happiness on the altar of fame, as so many others did. She had both.<p></p> <b>Q:</b> Would modern-day Hollywood exist without Elizabeth Taylor?<p></p> <b>A:</b> Well, it sure would look a heck of lot different. Elizabeth was the first female star to demand a million dollars a picture and a percent of the grosses. The deals she struck in the early 1960s really changed the financial structure of Hollywood. When she heard not long ago that Julia Roberts was getting something like twenty million a picture, she just smiled and said, "I started it." I think it's a perfect irony that a woman who so loathed the old studio system helped create the business model that replaced it.<p></p> <b>Q:</b> What else do you reveal about Elizabeth that we never knew before?<p></p> <b>A:</b> There's considerable new information on her mother, a fascinating woman in her own right, as well about as Mike Todd, Elizabeth's third husband who really set her on the road to the kind of extraordinary fame she eventually enjoyed. There are some important re-considerations on how she met and married Todd, and the same with Eddie Fisher, and then Richard Burton. It's so important to understand these people's lives in context with everyone else that was happening around them, and I attempt to do that here with Elizabeth, to not have her life read like pages from some old <i>Photoplay</i> magazine.<p></p> <b>Q:</b> But to do that, you need fresh sources. Did you find new sources writing the book?<p></p> <b>A:</b> I was fortunate to get many people close to Elizabeth to speak with me, both on and off the record. I was also able to get my hands on important documents that had never been used before or severely under-utilized. A journal kept by the producer of <i>Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf</i> allowed me to get an inside, up-close view of the making of that picture. George Stevens' personal papers recreated the intimate day-to-day production of <i>Giant</i> and <i>A Place in the Sun</i>. Then there were Hedda Hopper's private letters and Mike Todd's FBI files and records from the MGM legal department and depositions Elizabeth gave in the lawsuit Fox brought against her. You really have dig out this new stuff or else you end up relying on old newspaper clippings, which are recycled by every biographer.<br> <br> <br> <p> <b>Photographs from <i>How to Be a Movie Star: Elizabeth Taylor in Hollywood</i></b><br><b>(Click on Images to Enlarge)</b><br> </p><p></p><p> </p><table><tbody><tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>1939: Elizabeth with her mother Sara, and brother Howard</td> <td>1941: Elizabeth's first publicity photo, Universal Studios</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p></p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>1945: Elizabeth posing with Roddy McDowall</td> <td>Early 1950s: Publicity photo (photo not included in the book)</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <br> <br><p><b>WILLIAM J.

Good, because I have a few thoughts about neighbors that I&#x2019;d like to share with you.<br> &nbsp;<br> Here&#x2019;s something I&#x2019;ve noticed in my ten years on this planet: Every neighborhood has at least one really weird person in it.<br> &nbsp;<br> I bet you&#x2019;ve got one in your neighborhood. It might be someone with a ton of gnome statues on their lawn. Or someone who sings to the vegetables in their garden. Or maybe it&#x2019;s someone who puts little red rain boots on their dog.<br> &nbsp;<br> On my old block, there was a woman who had a pet tortoise named Speedo. She took Speedo out for a walk every day&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. on a leash! It took them most of the day to make it to the corner and back.<br> &nbsp;<br> My dad says when he was young, he had a neighbor named Louie who collected balls. Golf balls, soccer balls, tennis balls, footballs, volleyballs, Ping-Pong balls, Wiffle balls, you name it. If my dad and his friends were playing and a ball went into Louie&#x2019;s yard, he kept it. They called him Old Louie the Ball Eater.<br> &nbsp;<br> I promise you, no one in the world has a neighbor weirder than mine. Her name is Viola Dots. She lives in a run-down house right next to our duplex. She&#x2019;s almost eighty years old and hasn&#x2019;t left her house in fifty years! All she does is paint copies of great works of art. Oh, and did I mention that she has a talking orange pig named Chives who&#x2019;s her butler?<br> &nbsp;<br> But that&#x2019;s not even the weirdest part. The strangest thing about Viola Dots is that she has a magical picture frame in her living room. At four o&#x2019;clock, which we call the hour of power, this frame is able to suck you into the picture if you&#x2019;re standing nearby. You go flying across time and space into whatever artwork is in the frame. If you&#x2019;re not back at the same place by five o&#x2019;clock, you&#x2019;re stuck in the painting forever. That&#x2019;s what happened to Viola&#x2019;s son, David, fifty years ago. And that&#x2019;s why she paints all day, every day&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She&#x2019;s hoping that he&#x2019;ll show up in her paintings.<br> &nbsp;<br> Viola&#x2019;s fantastic frame is a secret. Only Chives, my friend Luna Lopez, and I know about it. And, of course, you. But you have to keep it a secret, because if you don&#x2019;t, people will come to her house and try to take the magical frame. She doesn&#x2019;t want that. At least, not until she finds David.<br> &nbsp;<br> So you have to promise to keep the fantastic frame a secret. Can you do that?<br> &nbsp;<br> Good. If you can, then read on. If you can&#x2019;t, pretend you never read this.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br><b> Chapter 1</b><br> &nbsp;<br> The ghost crept closer and closer, its eyes glowing red. It had no bones, only a hollow body that seemed to be made of swirling fog. I could see through its long arms as they reached out to grab me. A chill ran down my spine.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I am coming to get you,&#x201d; the ghost cried. A slimy fluid poured out of the hole where its mouth should have been. My heart was beating wildly. Suddenly, something moved on the couch next to me, and I jumped about ten feet in the air.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was my friend, Luna Lopez. &#x201c;Okay, Tiger, I&#x2019;ll be changing the channel now,&#x201d; she said, standing up from the couch and clicking the remote control.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But, Luna, we&#x2019;re not even at the good part where the ghost freaks out.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t watch this, Tiger,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s way too creepy. I like my ghosts in a good mood. The same way I like my mummies, my vampires, and my werewolves.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But it&#x2019;s fun to be scared. It&#x2019;s just a movie.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> It was a Thursday night and my parents were at an open house at Rainbow Years, my little sister Maggie&#x2019;s preschool. The four-year-old class was putting on a skit, and Maggie was playing a mushroom in the forest. I thought it was a great part for her, because she reminds me of a fungus. Our babysitter was busy, so my mom asked Luna&#x2019;s grandmother if she could watch me until they got home. Se�ora Lopez had fallen asleep in her rocking chair.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Come on, Luna, just give it five more minutes,&#x201d; I urged.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m warning you. The minute that spooky phantom moans again, I&#x2019;m out of here.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> We settled on the couch to watch the movie. The ghost had calmed down and was just floating outside the haunted house, looking in the windows. The only sounds in the room were Luna&#x2019;s grandmother snoring and the scary music coming from the TV. Suddenly, we heard a noise by the living room window. Clink-clink-clink followed by the rattle of the windowpane.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; Luna whispered. There was a little panic in her voice.<br> &nbsp;<br> It sounded like someone was throwing rocks at the window. We waited, hoping the rock thrower had left. But then we heard it again. Clink-clink-clink.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to check it out,&#x201d; I said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m coming with you.&#x201d; Luna picked up a throw pillow from the couch. &#x201c;If it&#x2019;s a ghost, I&#x2019;ll swat him with this.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;If it&#x2019;s really a ghost, that pillow&#x2019;s going to go right through him,&#x201d; I pointed out.<br> &nbsp;<br> We crept over to the window and looked out, just as three more pebbles hit the glass in front of us. It was dark outside, and I couldn&#x2019;t make out who was standing below. I opened the window a crack.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s down there?&#x201d; I called out.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re a ghost, go away,&#x201d; Luna added.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It is I,&#x201d; said a familiar voice. &#x201c;Chives. I must speak with you two right away about an urgent matter.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Chives,&#x201d; I said in my loudest whisper. &#x201c;What are you doing out?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;At the risk of repeating myself, young sir, I must see you immediately on a matter of great importance.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I glanced over at Se�ora Lopez, who was still asleep in the chair. Luna and I tiptoed past her and hurried down the stairs. We found Chives standing in the driveway, pacing back and forth. He is always calm. It was not like him to be this upset.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Madame Dots,&#x201d; he said, taking out a handkerchief and blowing his snout. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m terribly worried about her.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with her?&#x201d; Luna asked.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I made her a cup of rose hips tea this afternoon,&#x201d; Chives said. &#x201c;She is always in the living room, painting, but when I brought it to her today, she was gone.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Maybe she finally decided to go outside and get some sun,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;No offense, Chives, but a little sunshine wouldn&#x2019;t hurt her.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Tiger, that&#x2019;s so rude,&#x201d; Luna whispered, giving me a poke in the ribs.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I searched every room and finally discovered her in young Master David&#x2019;s bedroom,&#x201d; Chives went on. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s kept that room locked since he disappeared into the fantastic frame.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What was she doing in there?&#x201d; Luna asked.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Touching everything on his shelves,&#x201d; Chives answered. &#x201c;His collections of records, arrowheads, geodes, and model cars.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Maybe she was just cleaning,&#x201d; I suggested. &#x201c;My mom is always threatening to go into my room and clean all the junk off my shelves. Last week she threw out my rubber-band collection.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No, Madame Dots was definitely looking for something,&#x201d; Chives said. &#x201c;I stayed with her for hours, until she found what she was looking for.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What was it?&#x201d; Luna and I both asked at once.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A birthday card,&#x201d; Chives said with a sniffle, &#x201c;that her son, David, was making for her on the day he disappeared. She said she had to see it again.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You mean, he disappeared on her birthday?&#x201d; Luna asked. &#x201c;How horrible.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; Chives nodded his head. &#x201c;Tomorrow it will be fifty years. And tomorrow she will turn eighty years old.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What a sad birthday that will be for her,&#x201d; Luna said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes indeed,&#x201d; Chives agreed. &#x201c;Unless, of course, you two can bring David home to her. Then it will be a day of great celebration.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Wow, no pressure there,&#x201d; I said.<br> &nbsp;<br> Luna poked me in the ribs again. I guess I was having a rude kind of day.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Does Mrs. Dots have a finished painting ready for us to enter tomorrow?&#x201d; Luna asked. &#x201c;Maybe we can find David.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I believe so,&#x201d; Chives said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a copy of a beautiful piece done in 1936 by the American artist Georgia O&#x2019;Keeffe. It&#x2019;s called Red Hills with the Pedernal, and it&#x2019;s a painting of a famous mountain in New Mexico.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That sounds exciting,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Bring on the hour of power!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never climbed a mountain,&#x201d; Luna said. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m willing to try if we think David might be there.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;This is a very special mountain,&#x201d; Chives explained. &#x201c;It is sacred to many Native American tribes, like the Navajo. Some tribes even believe it is home to important spirits.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Spirits?&#x201d; Luna said with a shudder. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t mean like ghosts, do you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Before Chives could answer, we saw headlights coming down our street and heard three quick taps of a horn. That&#x2019;s my dad&#x2019;s special honk.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;My parents are back,&#x201d; I said to Chives. &#x201c;Hurry or they&#x2019;ll see you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Until tomorrow then,&#x201d; Chives said. &#x201c;We will meet at the fantastic frame at four o&#x2019;clock, the hour of power, with brave thoughts and high expectations.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He tipped his top hat, turned, and ran down the driveway, slipping into the side door of Viola&#x2019;s house just as our car pulled up. Maggie, the little blabbermouth, stuck her head out of the car window.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I see you!&#x201d; she hollered. &#x201c;I see you, Mr. Orange Pig.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Of course, my parents didn&#x2019;t see him. You only see an orange pig if you&#x2019;re looking for one. My mom lifted Maggie out of her car seat and rubbed her mushroomy head.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Maggie has seen lots of imaginary creatures tonight,&#x201d; she laughed. &#x201c;Unicorns and elves and dragons and trolls. The forest was full of them. Wasn&#x2019;t it, honey?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That pig wasn&#x2019;t in my imagination,&#x201d; Maggie insisted.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Four-year-olds,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Who knows what&#x2019;s in their goofy little heads?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Luna and I laughed, a bit too hard.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go wash the moss out of your hair,&#x201d; my mom said to Maggie. &#x201c;Maybe we&#x2019;ll see Mr. Pig in the bathtub.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I felt a little bad that my mom didn&#x2019;t believe Maggie. But then, it&#x2019;s hard to believe a talking mushroom.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I thought you kids were going to watch a movie,&#x201d; my dad said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We started to, but it was a ghost movie and we decided to turn it off.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh, got a tad scared, did you?&#x201d; my dad asked. &#x201c;Well, things that go bump in the night can be pretty scary.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Those things aren&#x2019;t real, are they, Mr. Brooks?&#x201d; Luna asked. &#x201c;Like phantoms and ghosts&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they don&#x2019;t really exist. I mean, they wouldn&#x2019;t actually live on, oh let&#x2019;s say, a mountain in New Mexico, would they?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never been to New Mexico,&#x201d; my dad said. &#x201c;The natural world is full of stories about all kinds of amazing things. You never know what you&#x2019;re going to find until you&#x2019;re there. But hey, nothing for us to worry about. We&#x2019;re not in New Mexico.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> It was dark and I couldn&#x2019;t see Luna&#x2019;s face.<br> &nbsp;<br> But I was pretty sure I heard her gulp.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Stoneflies for the Angler</h2><p>An authorative, comprehensive guide to these important trout food insects.

His reverence for nature and his deep religious faith are palpable, and he argues convincingly for the "small-scale diversified farming" of the Amish, which ultimately gives back to the earth more than it takes. The book should be of particular interest to birders, but just as notable is the sheer pleasure of its language, as seen in Kline's spring reverie of "the creaking of the harness and the popping of alfalfa roots," the "tinkling song of the horned lark and the lisping of the migrating water pipits." <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Stranger by Night (The Hot Blood Series)</h2><p>A collection of erotic horror stories highlights the works of such authors as Ramsey Campbell, Brian Lumley, Graham Masterton, Brink Stevens, Brian Hodge, Edward Lee, Lucy Taylor, and Mike Newton.

His voyage was one of history&#x2019;s greatest feats of daring, discovery, cartography, and diplomacy. The young captain, however, harbored an illness that would slowly drive him mad, and his triumphs were overshadowed by bitter smear campaigns initiated by enemies he made on board. His adversaries secretly sent word back home of his actions, and he was judged and condemned by London&#x2019;s aristocratic elite. Vancouver died disgraced and in poverty. <i>Madness, Betrayal and the Lash</i> is a long overdue re-evaluation of one of the greatest explorers of the Age of Discovery. It's a gripping tale of adventure at sea, the struggle of empires, and one man&#x2019;s battle against illness, the isolation of command, and a polarizing class system.</p><p><p><strong>Stephen R. Bown</strong> is the author of many critically acclaimed, award-winning titles, including most recently <em>White Eskimo</em> (Douglas &amp; McIntyre, 2015), which was the winner of the 2016 William Mills Prize for Non-Fiction Polar Books. Bown lives in the Canadian Rockies.</p>Though mostly forgotten, the 1791-95 voyage of Capt. George Vancouver and his crew rivaled Columbus and Cook's for long-term impact; Vancouver's painstaking navigation through the uncharted Pacific set the path for modern North Pacific history. Bown (Scurvy, A Most Damnable Invention) provides a thorough, engaging account of a journey remarkable for its time and even more so in retrospect. Essential background information is flawed by excessive foreshadowing, but Bown's vivid account of Vancouver's work-mapping the labyrinthine coast between Northern California and southern Alaska, stopping off in Hawaii and Spanish California-proves fascinating. Plans for the voyage changed repeatedly; the end of the American Revolution, Britain's long rivalry with Spain, the pressure for new trade routes, manipulation by British politicians and fur traders, and the obsession with finding a Northwest Passage made a difficult, vague assignment nearly impossible. The last chapters read like a thriller, as Vancouver's health declines, his relations with the crew sour, and Britain and France go to war. Any fan of the Great Age of Sail, the history of the Royal Navy, or European voyages of exploration will enjoy rediscovering this almost-forgotten hero. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

However, when a small-time criminal is found dead McCaleb is persuaded to profile the killer. Six years ago the victim had been arrested by Harry Bosch for murder but was later released uncharged. In doing what he does best, reviewing the crime scene tapes and investigative records, McCaleb picks up a clue the sheriffs missed, and discovers that the killer left a message at the crime scene - a message that seems to implicate Detective Harry Bosch...Meanwhile Bosch is in the midst of a high stakes trial being covered in the press by Jack McEvoy. Bosch was lead investigator on a murder case that saw the arrest of the son of a wealthy and powerful man. As the trial progresses the defence strategy becomes clear: put Bosch on trial instead of the rich kid, make the focus on Bosch and his methods. McCaleb and Bosch, first at odds, must now work together to clear Harry&#39;s name.</p><p>When a sheriff's detective shows up on former FBI man Terry McCaleb's Catalina Island doorstep and requests his help in analyzing photographs of a crime scene, McCaleb at first demurs. He's newly married (to Graciela, who herself dragged him from retirement into a case in <i>Blood Work</i>), has a new baby daughter, and is finally strong again after a heart transplant. But once a bloodhound, always a bloodhound. One look at the video of Edward Gunn's trussed and strangled body puts McCaleb back on the investigative trail, hooked by two details: the small statue of an owl that watches over the murder scene and the Latin words "Cave Cave Dus Videt," meaning "Beware, beware, God sees," on the tape binding the victim's mouth. <p> Gunn was a small-time criminal who had been questioned repeatedly by LAPD Detective Harry Bosch in the unsolved murder of a prostitute, most recently on the night he was killed. McCaleb knows the tense, cranky Bosch (Michael Connelly's series star--see <i>The Black Echo</i>, <i>The Black Ice</i>, et al.) and decides to start by talking to him. But Bosch has time only for a brief chat. He's a prosecution witness in the high-profile trial of David Storey, a film director accused of killing a young actress during rough sex. By chance, however, McCaleb discovers an abstruse but concrete link between the scene of Gunn's murder and Harry Bosch's name: </p><blockquote>"This last guy's work is supposedly replete with owls all over the place. I can't pronounce his first name. It's spelled H-I-E-R-O-N-Y-M-U-S. He was Netherlandish, part of the northern renaissance. I guess owls were big up there."<p> McCaleb looked at the paper in front of him. The name she had just spelled seemed familiar to him.</p><p> "You forgot his last name. What's his last name?"</p><p> "Oh, sorry. It's Bosch. Like the spark plugs."</p></blockquote> Bosch fits McCaleb's profile of the killer, and McCaleb is both thunderstruck and afraid--thunderstruck that a cop he respects might have committed a horrendous murder and afraid that Bosch may just be good enough to get away with it. And when Bosch finds out (via a mysterious leak to tabloid reporter Jack McEvoy, late of Connelly's <i>The Poet</i>) that he's being investigated for murder, he's furious, knowing that Storey's defense attorney may use the information to help get his extravagantly guilty client off scot-free.<p> It's the kind of plot that used to make great Westerns: two old gunslingers circling each other warily, each of them wondering if the other's gone bad. But there's more than one black hat in them thar hills, and Connelly masterfully joins the plot lines in a climax and denouement that will leave readers gasping but satisfied. <i>--Barrie Trinkle</i></p>8 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Vikings in 30 Seconds (Kids 30 Second)</h2><p>With fast facts, mini missions, and engaging artwork, <i>Vikings in 30 Seconds</i> is the perfect introduction to one of the world&#x2019;s most fascinating cultures.<br><br> Children will discover all about these amazing warriors, including where they came from, their incredible skill as boat builders and seafarers, and how they traded with and settled in distant lands.<br><br> Each topic is presented in a concise 30-second summary, supported by a 3-second flash soundbite, and full-color artwork.

While the theater investigated representations of religious and ethnic identity in its portrayals of Turks and Muslims, poetry, Miriam Jacobson argues, explored East-West exchanges primarily through language and the material text. Just as English markets were flooded with exotic goods, so was the English language awash in freshly imported words describing items such as sugar, jewels, plants, spices, paints, and dyes, as well as technological advancements such as the use of Arabic numerals in arithmetic and the concept of zero.</p><p>Even as these Eastern words and imports found their way into English poetry, poets wrestled with paying homage to classical authors and styles. In <i>Barbarous Antiquity</i>, Jacobson reveals how poems adapted from Latin or Greek sources and set in the ancient classical world were now reoriented to reflect a contemporary, mercantile Ottoman landscape. As Renaissance English writers including Shakespeare, Jonson, Marlowe, and Chapman weighed their reliance on classical poetic models against contemporary cultural exchanges, a new form of poetry developed, positioned at the crossroads of East and West, ancient and modern. Building each chapter around the intersection of an Eastern import and a classical model, Jacobson shows how Renaissance English poetry not only reconstructed the classical past but offered a critique of that very enterprise with a new set of words and metaphors imported from the East.</p></p><p>Miriam Jacobson is Associate Professor of English at the University of Georgia.<p>Introduction<br>Trafficking with Antiquity: Trade, Poetry, and Remediation</p><p>In the poetry of late sixteenth-century England, writers struggled with ambivalence toward ancient, Latin, and Greek poetic paradigms. Classical antiquity was already estranged: as a fragmented, partially obscured, and lost "golden age," it was only partly accessible through its literary remains. Though they wrote in vernacular English, most early modern writers were nevertheless schooled in Latin from childhood. As they wrestled with this literary legacy, writers turned to contemporary mercantile trade for new models and metaphors. Much of this trade was located in the Levant, the same space occupied by the classical myths that inspired much of early modern poetry. In this way, the classical antiquity represented in early modern English poetry became newly barbarous.</p><p>The growing appetite for foreign goods and England's increased diplomacy with the Ottoman Empire had an impact not only on early modern drama but on poetry as well, and this can be traced, in part, through philology. In 1581, the Turkey Company was founded, the first successful English trade company to begin importing goods into England directly from Turkey (previously the Russia Company traded with the East, attempting trade with Persia). In 1593, the Turkey Company officially became the Levant Company. The first English ambassadors to the Ottoman Empire were merchants; thus, Anglo-Ottoman diplomatic relations were from the start bound up with trade. And with trade came new imports and new, imported English words for such things, words for things that, though they must have been known to the ancient classical world, did not have Greek or Latin names. And these words were quickly adopted and assimilated by English poets, figuring prominently in poetry that still paid homage to ancient Greek and Roman models.</p><p>It would be a Herculean task to document the number of newly assimilated late sixteenth-century English words that describe goods and practices imported from the Far East and North Africa by way of the Ottoman Mediterranean, a task that no one has accomplished thus far. As the appetite for imported luxury goods continued to grow in this period, words for exotic spices and pharmaceuticals&#x2014;including <i>sugar</i>, <i>candy</i>, <i>syrup</i>, <i>julep</i>, <i>marzipan</i>, and <i>eryngo</i>&#x2014;enhanced the vocabularies of English writers, dyers, and culinary artists. Although words for some of these objects were in use in English in the late Middle Ages, the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> reveals that their English meanings shifted and expanded greatly in the middle of the sixteenth century. A variety of words connected with artists' pigments and the dyed textile trade were introduced into the English language in this period, words like <i>crimson</i> (from Turkish <i>kirmiz</i>, a beetle crushed to create the scarlet dye), <i>turquoise</i>, <i>indigo</i>, and <i>ultramarine</i> (from their places of origin in Turkey, India, and a place "beyond the sea," the Lapis mines of Afghanistan). The terms for the different types of flowering bulbs imported from Turkey&#x2014;including <i>tulip</i>, which takes its name from the Arabic word for turban&#x2014;were so numerous that they took up twenty-five additional pages between the first and second editions of Gerard's <i>Herball</i> in 1597 and 1633.</p><p>In early modern English, the word <i>import</i> functioned only as a verb, not as a noun in the sense that I am using it. The terms <i>merchandise</i>, <i>wares</i>, and <i>goods</i> described what we now call imports. By the middle of the seventeenth century, English writers were already describing imported words as if they were merchandise. A dedicatory poem states this boldly in the front matter of Thomas Blount's English lexicon <i>Glossographia: or a Dictionary, Interpreting all such Hard Words, Whether Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Italian, Spanish, French, Teutonick, Belgick, British or Saxon; as are now used in our refined English Tongue</i> (1656): "And, as with Merchandize, with terms it fares, / Nations do traffic Words, as well as Wares." Blount's address to his readers emphasizes the abundance of imported foreign words assimilated into English, depicting each culture's contribution almost as a plundering of treasure.</p><p>We can draw a parallel between these imported words' currency in English and the way the goods they refer to were imported through early modern mercantile markets. These words might be seen as global versions of what Pierre Bourdieu has termed the "economy of linguistic exchange." A similar collection of Eastern (Turkish, Sanskrit, Persian, and Semitic) words and imports began to function as <i>poetic currency</i> in the texts that this book examines, mirroring and mimicking the way that the materials they signified functioned as global commodities within the Ottoman Mediterranean. Jonathan Gil Harris has recently noted the correlation between the migration of pepper as an Indian import to Europe and to the New World, and then back to Asia, and the way the words <i>pepper</i> and its cognate, <i>pimiento</i>, similarly moved from Indian through European, American, and Oriental vocabularies. To clarify, then: foreign words come into England with foreign trade, and many of them describe the new goods that have entered the country. But unlike the imports they denote (the material objects signified), these words were not exchanged for money or other words within the English language: they circulated freely. More important, these words circulated <i>associatively</i>, forming a web or network of meanings and associations rather than corresponding one to one with the object they signified. Thus, an early modern reader might encounter the word <i>orient</i> while reading Marlowe's <i>Hero and Leander</i> and associate the word with any number of different things&#x2014;the East, a sunrise, a bright light, a nacreous pearl. The formulation of early modern language proposed by Foucault, which has been adopted by other scholars of early modern material textuality and philology serves as a useful model here. Foucault imagines early modern language as a web of associations, with meanings "renewed in every interval, which combines here and there with the forms of the world and becomes interwoven with them." Each of the words this book examines forms a point in this web composed of many different associative strands. The meaning of the word thus fluctuates throughout the early modern text, just as it fluctuates throughout early modern culture.</p><p>Just as the imported goods in question did not supplant established commodities, these words augmented English vocabularies. As poetic currency, new words did not replace existing imagery; they enhanced it. Even in English translations of Latin, new words amplify the original text: the early modern English word <i>cipher</i> (zero, imported from the Middle East) shows up in Marlowe's translation of Ovid's <i>Amores</i> 3.6 to describe impotence, and the word <i>orient</i> (nacreous) appears several times in Philemon Holland's translation of Pliny's <i>Historia Naturalis</i>, describing the luminescent quality of pearls. Though <i>orient</i> is of Latin origin, starting in the middle of the sixteenth century, this word was used to refer to a pearl's shine. Though they may have encountered these concepts, neither Pliny nor Ovid had access to any of these <i>words</i>; they came to Europe by way of mercantile exchange but were only naturalized when European traders began to adopt them in practice. <i>Zero</i> was adopted through contact with Arab and South Asian mathematical culture, and jewel merchants brought back pearls from the Persian Gulf and Sri Lanka, utilizing the term <i>orient</i> as a way of grading and valuing a gem.</p><p>The central premise of <i>Barbarous Antiquity</i> is that the growing English appetite for strange things and stranger words extended to literary production: poets and printers of the period responded to the same allure by incorporating foreign words and images into their poetry&#x2014;texts that simultaneously paid homage to ancient Greek and Roman writers and styles. These words and images inaugurate a new poetic economy, reconfiguring cultural attitudes toward ancient and modern, East and West, and redefining what it meant to write and publish poetry in English during the Renaissance. Often imported words or names for imported things appear only a few times within a poetic text, but what matters is their placement at key moments of the narrative, not their frequency. Working together with imagery, as verbal representations of foreign merchandise, words and things create new networks of associations with early modern overseas trade.</p><p>Although early modern global trade and Anglo-Ottoman relations have been a popular topic in early modern literary scholarship, few studies have turned from analyses of drama to poetry. This is partly because the early modern stage was prime space for negotiating issues of cultural and religious identity, and with the exception of Spenser's <i>Faerie Queene</i>, we rarely find representations of Turks, Muslims, and Saracens in early modern poetry modeled on classical narrative and lyric. The majority of stage depictions of Ottoman characters engage with negative representations of the powerful, early modern Ottoman Empire as bloodthirsty, idolatrous, sybaritic, and overly militaristic, representations that can also be found in the multiplicity of meanings for the word <i>Turk</i> in the period, many of which point to uncouth and barbaric behavior.</p><p>As Jonathan Burton has demonstrated, early modern English poetry is fairly uninterested in Turkish racial or religious identity, other than to stereotype it. In looking for representations of Turks themselves in poetry, Burton finds no evidence of the Turks as "trading partners as allies." But what if we turn our attention away from Ottoman identity and look for Ottoman imports? We do find references to mercantilism and non-Western commodities in poetry. And as Roland Greene has demonstrated in his analysis of Petrarchism, many early modern English poetic forms, like the sonnet, were themselves imports, originating in Persian and Arab literary culture and making their way into Britain through Italy by way of Mediterranean trade routes. As this book will show, early modern poetry depicted England's exchanges with trading partners to the East and South differently from drama, through language and imagery of imported commodities rather than through positive or negative representations of Ottoman identity. Commodities imported from the eastern Mediterranean were often ornate luxury goods, which had much in common with early modern metaphors for poetic ornament as oriental gemstones, imported cosmetics, pigments, and dyes.</p><p>Trafficking with the East</p><p>Engaging directly with the Ottomans for the first time, the English disrupted and reoriented the flow of trade around the Mediterranean. Up to this period, goods originating in the Ottoman and Islamic Middle East and North Africa had come into England by way of the Catholic European West (Italy, France, Portugal, and Spain). Once the English began offering British woolen "kersies" and English-mined tin and lead directly to Turkey, Venetian and French middlemen could no longer offer English wool to the Turks at higher cost. The flow of traffic no longer moved east to west along a horizontal axis; it now moved north to England and south to North Africa, in widening circles and arcs.</p><p>The word <i>East</i> serves here as a fragile placeholder for a number of different global coordinates and cultures (among them eastern Europe, central Asia, Anatolia, the Maghreb, Persia, India, and Indonesia). The Ottoman Empire is only "the East" when viewed from the European perspective. <i>East</i> implies a division between Europe as West, Asia and North Africa as East, but this bilateral division was not clear in sixteenth-century cartography. Where was the line drawn, when the Ottoman Empire's borders were liquid and flexible? Equally useful to understanding early modern English global geography is the notion of North and South, where the South encompasses not only the Italian Mediterranean, but Spain and North Africa as well. To early modern readers and writers on all sides of the Mediterranean, the late sixteenth-century Ottoman Empire was more than simply the "East," a diachronic space in the history of dialogue between East and West. That empire held a uniquely polychronic space, not only because of the multiple temporalities it encompassed, as the current occupant of the lands formerly part of ancient Greece and Rome, but because it constructed its own space in a more malleable, fluid way. Its lands and seas stretched from the Greek islands across the Mediterranean and south to North Africa, east to Jerusalem, and up into central Asia. As Palmira Brummett's and Halil Inalcik's histories of early modern Ottoman expansion have shown, the Ottoman Empire's boundaries were defined by sea trade more than by land conquest, and they were almost always subject to change. On the one hand, the Ottomans redefined empire by blending trade with diplomacy, seafaring with conquest, creating something new and different from the Western empires of the classical past. On the other hand, sixteenth-century Ottoman rulers themselves were aware of the layered temporal landscapes they inhabited, redefining themselves as new Roman rulers. Both the Ottoman sultans and the Hapsburg emperors in the sixteenth century "would aspire to resurrect the Roman Empire."</p><p>Because of the fluidity of the Ottoman Empire's borders and its translation of diplomacy into trade, early modern engagements between England and the Ottoman Empire thus participate in something different from a linear discourse of East and West; they create multitemporal and transglobal configurations. As Jerry Brotton's analysis of sixteenth-century cartography reveals, early modern European travelers and explorers also viewed the classical world and the lands occupied by the Ottoman Empire as one and the same: "The supposedly 'western' world of Europe actually defined itself as coextensive with, rather than in contradistinction to, the classical world of the east, whatever its intellectual and cultural dimensions." We can join Brotton's analysis of a coextensive East and West with Jonathan Gil Harris's multilayered approach to history, which entails moving beyond diachronic and synchronic models of narrative space in favor of multitemporal, or "polychronic" strata. In other words, for English eyes, the lands of the early modern Ottoman Empire were in the process of becoming the "East" but were not fixed in space or time. They were also, at the same time, lands of classical antiquity and ancient Greek myth. The site of ancient Troy, near ancient Abydos, was also the site of an Ottoman military garrison: both places were coextensive and equally present for early modern readers and travelers.</p><p>One such traveler and writer was George Sandys, who is known for his English translation of Ovid's <i>Metamorphoses</i> (1632). Sandys wrote an extensive and richly illustrated narrative documenting his travels across Europe to the Ottoman Empire in 1610. As an antiquarian, he was "curious in the search of Antiquities," keen to explore the monumental ...</p></p><h2>Angelic Healing: Working with Your Angel to Heal Your Life</h2><p>Combining past wisdom with dozens of intimate accounts, this inspirational book shows how individuals can tap into angelic resources to overcome many hurts--serious illnesses, addictions, bad relationships--and develop a sense of personal empowerment.

Conversely, there is the raw and crude violence of those who live lives of poverty or crime. As DI Joe Faraday doggedly seeks a murderer, he confronts all of the city's realities. Narrator Tim Pepper is splendid delivering the novel's descriptive and varied language. He particularly excels in portraying the relationship between Faraday and his deaf son. Listeners will be satisfied by this atmospheric piece.

This abundantly illustrated nonthreatening guide is filled with effective maintenance, repair, and advanced troubleshooting advice for two-cycle and four-cycle engines from 2 to 250 horsepower. Although outboard engines have become more reliable, they're also more sophisticated and require more than a passing knowledge of mechanics to troubleshoot and repair. <i>Outboard Engines</i> covers recent developments such as electronic ignition, oil injection systems, and four-stroke powerheads. Your fears about the reliability of your "finicky" outboard are over!</p><p>Ed Sherman is a well-known boating writer and educator, and the author of two International Marine books: Outboard Engines (1997) and Powerboater&#39;s Guide to Electrical Systems (2000).

Each section also takes place at a different point in the life of a young Pueblo hunter who is both mystical and mythical. His voice and poetry blend with those of his elders and the narrator to form a "song" of sacred oral tradition. Decidedly difficult to categorize in any mainstream genre, the narrative feeds the stereotype of the Native American as noble savage. It is certainly a different version of modern Indian life from that presented in, for example, Sherman Alexie's Reservation Blues and was probably meant to be just that. Still, books of this kind have great appeal in some libraries, and this one should be purchased accordingly, especially where recommended for Native American and Southwest regional collections are strong.

By addressing the significance of medical technology to the phenomenon of transsexualism, Bernice L. Hausman transforms current conceptions of transsexuality as a disorder of gender identity by showing how developments in medical knowledge and technology make possible the emergence of new subjectivities. <br>Hausman&#x2019;s inquiry into the development of endocrinology and plastic surgery shows how advances in medical knowledge were central to the establishment of the material and discursive conditions necessary to produce the demand for sex change&#x2014;that is, to both "make" and "think" the transsexual. She also retraces the hidden history of the concept of gender, demonstrating that the semantic distinction between "natural" sex and "social" gender has its roots in the development of medical treatment practices for intersexuality&#x2014;the condition of having physical characteristics of both sexes&#x2014; in the 1950s. Her research reveals the medical institution&#x2019;s desire to make heterosexual subjects out of intersexuals and indicates how gender operates semiotically to maintain heterosexuality as the norm of the human body. In critically examining medical discourses, popularizations of medical theories, and transsexual autobiographies, Hausman details the elaboration of "gender narratives" that not only support the emergence of transsexualism, but also regulate the lives of all contemporary Western subjects. <i>Changing Sex</i> will change the ways we think about the relation between sex and gender, the body and sexual identity, and medical technology and the idea of the human. <br></p><p>&#34;Building upon earlier critiques of the medical management of gender, Hausman provides a rich analysis of the significance of technology on this century&#39;s shift from looking for the &#34;true&#34; sex to the &#34;best&#34; one. Having tracked down valuable and fascinating sources, she gives a previously neglected historical perspective on transsexualism and intersexuality. Gender scholars from every discipline will find this book important.&#34;--Suzanne Kessler, Purchase College, State University of New York<p>Bernice L.

Simple in its fundamentals, infinitely complex in its execution, it is an essential expression of the Japanese sensibility. And in his fictional chronicle of a match played between a revered and invincible Master and a younger, more progressive challenger, Yasunari Kawabata captured the moment in which the immutable traditions of imperial Japan met the onslaught of the twentieth century. The competition between the Master of Go and his opponent, Otak &#39;, is waged over several months and layered in ceremony. But beneath the game&#39;s decorum lie tensions that consume not only the players themselves but their families and friends - tensions that turn this particular contest into a duel that can only end in one man&#39;s death. Luminous in its detail, both suspenseful and serene, The Master of Go is an elegy for an entire society, written with the poetic economy and psychological acumen that brought Kawabata the Nobel Prize for Literature.</p><p>Yasunari Kawabata, winner of the 1968 Nobel Prize for Literature, was one of Japan&#39;s most distinguished novelists. Born in Osaka in 1899, he published his first stories while he was still in high school. Among his major novels published across the world are Snow Country (1956), Thousand Cranes (1959), The Sound of the Mountain (1972), and Beauty and Sadness (1975).

In <i>The Dictator's Shadow</i>, United Nations Ambassador Heraldo Mu�oz takes advantage of his unmatched set of perspectives&#x2014;as a former revolutionary who fought the Pinochet regime, as a respected scholar, and as a diplomat&#x2014;to tell what this extraordinary figure meant to Chile, the United States, and the world.<p>Pinochet's American backers saw his regime as a bulwark against Communism; his nation was a testing ground for U.S.-inspired economic theories. Countries desiring World Bank support were told to emulate Pinochet's free-market policies, and Chile's government pension even inspired President George W. Bush's plan to privatize Social Security. The other baggage&#x2014;the assassinations, tortures, people thrown out of airplanes, mass murders of political prisoners&#x2014;was simply the price to be paid for building a modern state. But the questions raised by Pinochet's rule still remain: Are such dictators somehow necessary?</p><p>Horrifying but also inspiring, <i>The Dictator's Shadow</i> is a unique tale of how geopolitical rivalries can profoundly affect everyday life.</p></p><p>Ambassador <b>Heraldo Mu�oz</b> was Deputy Foreign Minister of Chile in 2000&#x2013;2002 and Minister Secretary General in 2002&#x2013;2003 at La Moneda Presidential Palace before assuming his present post as ambassador to the U.N., where he has served as President of the Security Council. The author of several scholarly books, he is frequently quoted on international issues by the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Washington Post</i>, <i>Financial Times</i>, and other journals. He lives in New York City.From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by Joshua Partlow One fall day in 1991, not long after Gen. Augusto Pinochet lost his grip on Chile, Heraldo Mu�oz, a socialist who had spent his life in both clandestine struggle and open opposition to the Pinochet regime, saw the old man himself approaching across a room at the Army War Academy. The former dictator had a pacemaker and was no longer Chile's president but remained commander-in-chief of the army, a post he'd held since 1973. Mu�oz, a diplomat and intellectual, had accepted an invitation from Pinochet to give a lecture, not expecting the general to attend. When Pinochet attempted to greet him after his talk, Mu�oz abruptly turned his back. "I could not bring myself to shake his hand," Mu�oz writes. "That was my closest brush with the man who had had such a baleful influence on my life -- and on the lives of a whole generation of Chileans." This anger, verging on disgust, toward Pinochet is the driving force in Mu�oz's meticulous and vivid new book, The Dictator's Shadow. He calls it a "political memoir," but it reads more as a compendium of crimes, whose specificity -- names and dates, weapon calibers, entry wound locations, torturers' techniques -- has a prosecutorial flavor, as if Mu�oz seeks to secure the conviction that Pinochet, who died in December 2006, successfully avoided during his lifetime. Mu�oz's impulse seems justified given the political climate in Chile, where Pinochet's legacy remains an open debate. The leftist leaders who came to power after Pinochet, now led by President Michelle Bachelet, galvanized popular support in response to the dictator's repression. Many suffered personally. Bachelet herself was imprisoned, and her father was tortured in jail and died in captivity. But other Chileans remember Pinochet as the economic savior who embraced privatization and free-market economics, allowing Chile the robust growth that made it the envy of other South American countries. "The agonizing question is: Was Pinochet necessary? Could Chile have reached its present prosperity without him?" Mu�oz asks at the outset of his book. Yet he does not really agonize over the question. The best he can bring himself to say about Pinochet is that the general sometimes selected competent economic advisers, even though he did not fully understand what they were telling him. Under Pinochet's long watch, an entrepreneurial spirit emerged in Chile, inflation was kept under control, and exports grew. But Mu�oz argues that this recovery could have occurred without the violence and repression. In the end, he contends, it was democracy, not Pinochet, that was necessary. Given Mu�oz's experience, it's hard to see how he could come to any other evaluation of the Pinochet regime. He was a socialist and a member of President Salvador Allende's leftist government (he served as national supervisor of the People's Stores, a food distribution program in poor neighborhoods) who went into hiding after Pinochet and other military officers overthrew Allende in a 1973 coup. The book opens with Mu�oz's recollection of retrieving four sticks of dynamite from a secret cache and rushing to a safe house, prepared to begin an armed resistance that did not materialize. He later took refuge in the United States, where he studied international relations alongside Condoleezza Rice at the University of Denver and was a fellow at the Brookings Institution. After Pinochet lost a 1988 plebiscite and eventually stepped aside, Mu�oz became a diplomat and is now Chile's ambassador to the United Nations. His access to top Chilean officials and once-secret documents enriches this history, allowing him to trace not only the conflict between Pinochet's team and the opposition but also the divisions within each camp. His account of an attempt by militant communists to assassinate Pinochet is particularly gripping. Mu�oz draws a damning portrait of the dictator as an officer of "limited intellect" who "was, above all else, a survivor." Raised in an upper middle-class family, Pinochet reluctantly joined the coup against Allende, then systematically pushed aside his fellow conspirators (and executed his political rivals) to seize sole control of the country. The qualities that put Pinochet in this position, Munoz writes, were uninspiring: "Insensitive and sardonic to those below him, he was crafty, submissive, and obsequious with his betters. Though Pinochet was anti-Communist, his ideology was self-interest." Once he seized power, as jets bombed the presidential palace and Allende committed suicide, the situation quickly turned grim. Several of the worst atrocities recounted in this book -- corralling opponents into the national soccer stadium in Santiago and executing more than 100 of them, the international plot known as Operation Condor to track down and kill dissidents -- have been documented at length elsewhere. Still, Mu�oz recounts them in chilling detail. He notes, for example, that to advance his career before the coup, Pinochet used to visit regularly with Foreign Minister Orlando Letelier and his family, bringing presents to the children. Yet a few years later, the author alleges, Pinochet ordered the assassination of Letelier, who was killed by a car bomb in Washington's Sheridan Circle in 1976. Even though democracy has returned to Chile for nearly 20 years, the wounds of Pinochet's 17-year reign are still being treated. In June, Gen. Manuel Contreras, former head of the secret police, was sentenced to two life terms in prison for his role in political slayings. And Chilean officials have proposed converting a former government torture house in Santiago into a museum. Mu�oz's memoir is part of a long, collective effort to uncover what the dictator and his henchmen buried in secrecy, fear and blood; in that sense, this book is a contribution to Chile's healing process. It can be slow reading, particularly when the author dwells on the minutiae of opposition politics, the endless meetings and internal disputes. But Mu�oz delivers a compelling, personal account of life in a police state and a strong reminder of how far Chile has come. <br>Copyright 2008, The Washington Post.

Eight other critical views of Eliot's text are offered here. <p>The title, T.S. Eliot&#x2019;s The Waste Land, part of Chelsea House Publishers&#x2019; Modern Critical Interpretations series, presents the most important 20th-century criticism on T.S. Eliot&#x2019;s The Waste Land through extracts of critical essays by well-known literary critics. This collection of criticism also features a short biography on T.S. Eliot, a chronology of the author&#x2019;s life, and an introductory essay written by Harold Bloom, Sterling Professor of the Humanities, Yale University.</p></p><p>T. S. Eliot (1888&#x2013;1965) was one of the fathers of modernism and a defining voice in English-language poetry. He is the author of some of the best known poems in the English language, including "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock," The Waste Land, "Ash Wednesday," and Four Quartets. The leading poet of the modernist avant-garde, Eliot radically reimagined the possibilities for literature in the twentieth century and beyond, and was also renowned as a playwright and as a literary and social critic. Eliot's books of criticism include The Sacred Wood, while his theatrical works include Murder in the Cathedral. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1948. <br> <br> Michael North is Professor of English at the University of California, Los Angeles. He is the author of The Dialect of Modernism: Race, Language, and Twentieth-Century Literature, The Final Sculpture: Public Monuments and Modern Poets, Reading 1922: A Return to the Scene of the Modern, The Political Aesthetic of Yeats, Eliot, and Pound, and Henry Green and the Writing of His Generation, as well as many articles on various aspects of twentieth-century literature.Long poem by T.S. Eliot, published in 1922, first in London in The Criterion (October), next in New York City in The Dial (November), and finally in book form, with footnotes by Eliot. The 433-line, five-part poem was dedicated to fellow poet Ezra Pound, who helped condense the original manuscript to nearly half its size. It was one of the most influential works of the 20th century. The Waste Land expresses with great power the disillusionment and disgust of the period after World War I. In a series of fragmentary vignettes, loosely linked by the legend of the search for the Grail, it portrays a sterile world of panicky fears and barren lusts, and of human beings waiting for some sign or promise of redemption. The depiction of spiritual emptiness in the secularized city--the decay of urbs aeterna (the "eternal city")--is not a simple contrast of the heroic past with the degraded present; it is rather a timeless, simultaneous awareness of moral grandeur and moral evil. The poem initially met with controversy as its complex and erudite style was alternately denounced for its obscurity and praised for its modernism. -- <i>The Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia of Literature</i></p><h2>Valiant Ambition George Washington, Benedict Arnold, and the Fate of the American Revolution</h2><p>From the Author&#39;s website: &#34;A surprising account of the middle years of the American Revolution, and the tragic relationship between George Washington and Benedict Arnold.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>TimeRiders: The Pirate Kings (Book 7)</h2><p>THIS IS BRAND NEW BOOK.WE PROVIDE 100% CUSTOMER SATISFACTION.</p><p>Alex Scarrow used to be a rock guitarist, then he became a graphic artist, then he decided to be a computer games designer.

I read Atalay's description of Leonardo's <i>The Last Supper</i> not long after having visited the masterpiece in Milan, for the first time since its restoration. His words added an unexpected poignancy to that sublime experience. Leonardo is the prototype for the renaissance man&#x2014;artist, architect, philosopher, scientist, writer.

Keep the translations coming."-<em>Booklist</em></p> <p>It is 1946. De Luca suffers from insomnia and has lost his appetite. He's got problems with women and a case that he can't crack. In this second installment of the heralded <em>De Luca trilogy,</em> the Commissario is posing as a certain Giovanni Morandi to avoid reprisals for the role he played during the fascist dictatorship. Exposed by a member of the partisan police, De Luca is forced to investigate a series of brutal murders, becoming a reluctant player in Italy's postwar power struggle.</p></p><p>Carlo Lucarelli is one of Italy&#39;s best-loved crime writers. He teaches at Alessandro Baricco&#39;s Holden School in Turin and in Padova&#39;s maximum security prison. He conducts the program &#34;Blue Night&#34; on Italian network television, and his novels Almost Blue and Lupo Mannaro have both been made into films.The second in the De Luca Trilogy to appear in the U.S. is set in 1946 and finds the former Commisario De Luca dodging partisan reprisals for the role he played as a member of the secret police under Mussolini. When he's recognized by a partisan in an isolated village between Bologna and Rome, De Luca--torn between the need to keep a low profile and the inevitable curiosity he feels in the face of an unsolved crime--reluctantly agrees to help investigate a double murder with political implications. The moral ambiguity at the heart of Italy's postwar power struggle permeates the action in this tense, atmospheric tale. The hero's own ambiguity about his actions during the war, as well as his cynical view of the postwar world, links him to other ideologically imperiled investigators (Arkady Renko in Martin Cruz Smith's Moscow-set series, for example), but the most notable aspect of this trilogy is Lucarelli's ability to give texture to a particular historical moment. <i>Bill Ott</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Berry Brazelton, has developed a theory of infant self-calming, a technique in which "the baby settles herself down without assistance from anyone." Sammons offers sound advice for new parents coping with feeding and quieting an infant, encouraging them to observe and communicate with the new baby. He warns parents against overstimulation, often the result of reacting too quickly to a baby's crying, and describes the different types of crying. He stresses teaching the infant to calm itself by sucking, visual focusing, or positioning, a process that can take weeks, but will result in improved family life.

The Rajneesh Chronicles explains this behavior--and why the cult that committed the first act of bioterrorism in the U.S. was trying to cultivate a live AIDS virus.</strong></p> Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, widely known as the "sex guru," fled India in 1981 and came to settle on a ranch in central Oregon, where he and his followers established the illegal city of Rajneeshpuram. In their effort to preserve the city, the Rajneeshees attempted during the 1984 election to take control of the Wasco County government by poisoning two county commissioners and over 700 potential voters in The Dalles, the county seat, with salmonella&#x2015;the first act of bio-terrorism in U.S. history. Armed to the teeth with semiautomatic weapons, they threatened to defend the city to the death against any governmental intrusion, and hatched a plot to assassinate a U.S attorney. When the commune finally imploded and authorities arrived on the scene, they discovered that the Rajneesh nurse who had cultivated salmonella bacteria in the commune&#x2019;s biological warfare laboratory was also trying to cultivate a live AIDS virus&#x2015;which deranged group leaders clearly hoped to unleash on the rest on the world. The Rajneesh Chronicles is a collection of in-depth investigative and analytical articles published in Oregon Magazine covering the entire period from the time of the cult&#x2019;s arrival in Oregon in mid-1981 to its dramatic disintegration at the end of 1985 (with an introductory chronology that extends the story up to the present). While most press treated the cult&#x2019;s antics as a humorous sideshow typified by the Bhagwan&#x2019;s dozens of Rolls-Royces, editor in chief Win McCormack and other of the magazine&#x2019;s writers systematically exposed the full range of the Rajneeshees&#x2019; depraved behavior, including their involvement in prostitution and international drug smuggling, sexual exploitation of children, abuse of homeless people they imported into Rajneeshpuram to register as voters, and the use of brainwashing techniques bordering on torture. The tale of the Rajneesh has become an amorphous legend few inside or outside of Oregon actually understand. The Rajneesh Chronicles fully illuminates the shocking reality behind that legend.</p><p>Win McCormack is publisher and editor-in-chief of Tin House magazine. He has been in the magazine and book publishing business since 1976. He published Oregon Magazine from 1976 to 1988, and has also been involved in publishing Oregon Business, Oregon Home, Travel Oregon, Military History Quarterly, and Art and Auction magazines, and was involved in the start-up of Mother Jones. He is editor of the books Profiles of Oregon, Great Moments in Oregon History, and The Rajneesh Chronicles, and won a William Allen White award for his investigative coverage of the Rajneesh cult from 1982-1986. He writes on politics and wrote the article &#34;Deconstructing the Election: Foucault, Derrida and GOP strategy,&#34; about the presidential election debacle in Florida in 2000, for the Nation. He holds a BA in Government from Harvard College and an MFA in Creative Writing from the University of Oregon.<br>"Win McCormack has put a penetrating spotlight on Indian guru Bhagwan Rajneesh and his bizarre and very dangerous cult.

Among fur-trade experts, Samuel Hearne is grudgingly recognized as the eighteenth-century British adventurer who, during a remarkable three-year odyssey, became the first European to reach the Arctic coast of North America. In <em>Ancient Mariner</em>, McGoogan demonstrates that Hearne was far more complex, accomplished and influential than the history books suggest.<p>Beginning with Hearne&#x2019;s entry into the Royal Navy at twelve years of age, McGoogan paints an authentic portrait of eighteenth-century British life, both on and off the wooden sailing ships. After serving as a midshipman during the tumultuous Seven Years&#x2019; War, Hearne moved to London and, in 1766, just twenty-one, joined the Hudson&#x2019;s Bay Company. Based at the company&#x2019;s northernmost fort, an ambitious Hearne embarked on an overland quest for rich veins of copper supposedly located &#x201c;far to the northward where the sun don&#x2019;t set&#x201d; and also to discover the Northwest Passage.</p><p>In his posthumously published journal, Hearne described the three-year odyssey a harrowing journey marked by hardship, hunger and disappointment, and mitigated only by his friendship with the legendary Dene leader Matonabbee. Hearne trekked more than 3,500 miles. His epic adventure culminated in the infamous and still-controversial massacre at &#x201c;Bloody Falls&#x201d; an event that, as McGoogan shows, changed him forever.</p><p>Drawing on naval history, fur-trade history and literary history, McGoogan portrays Hearne as a skilled navigator, a pioneering anthropologist, a ground-breaking naturalist and a gifted natural artist. He fell in love with a native woman and never fully recovered after she died tragically.</p><p> In a fascinating bit of literary detective work, McGoogan also determines that, having returned to London to live out his final days, Hearne met Samuel Taylor Coleridge and inspired the poet to write &#x201c;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.&#x201d; Suffused with McGoogan&#x2019;s inimitable passion and insight, sparkling with discoveries and reinterpretations, <em>Ancient Mariner</em> is destined to become the non-fiction book of the fall season.</p></p><p><p>KEN McGOOGAN&#x2019;s quartet of books about Arctic history&#x2014; <em>Fatal Passage</em>, <em>Ancient Mariner</em>, <em>Lady Franklin&#x2019;s Revenge</em> and <em>Race to the Polar Sea</em>&#x2014;have made him one of the most acclaimed popular historians in Canada and a national bestselling author.

Born and raised in Ireland, she lives in London.Three novels by Edna O'brien that follow the lives of friends Kate and Baba from their school days and strict Roman Catholic upbringing in the Irish countryside to their disillusioned adulthood and failed marriages in London.

In 1986, the three novels with an epilogue were published in one volume as <i>The Country Girls Trilogy and Epilogue</i>.

This absorbing narrative provides a comprehensive account of a momentous life, as it takes the reader on a journey from the composer&#x2019;s birth in Bonn to his death in Vienna.<br><br>Chronicling the landmark events in Beethoven's career from his competitive encounters with Mozart to the circumstances surrounding the creation of the well-known F�r Elise and Moonlight Sonata this book enhances understanding of the composer's character, inspiring a deeper appreciation for his work. Beethoven scholarship is constantly evolving, and Suchet draws on the latest research, using rare source material (some of which has never before been published in English) to paint a complete and vivid portrait of the legendary prodigy.</p><p>John Suchet is recognized as a leading authority on the life and works of Ludwig van Beethoven. This is his first full-length biography of the composer. He presents the morning program on Britain&#x2019;s Classic FM, and lives in London.Ludwig did more than teach piano to the Breuning children. He in effect grew up as part of the Breuning household, becoming almost a surrogate member of the family. [. . .] It was there, also, that he first became acquainted with German literature, especially poetry. It is beyond doubt that he will have been introduced to the works of the two emerging giants of German literature, Goethe and Schille. He read Homer and Plutarch. He was trained too in social etiquette. He even went away on holiday with the family. Helene von Breuning clearly took him under her wing and made it her duty to fill in the gaps academic and social that early exit from school and singular devotion to music had caused.<br><br>His father Johann remained of low standing, and was little more than a figure of ridicule. [. . .] Ludwig was in effect the family breadwinner. Given his father&#x2019;s alcoholism, he was also de facto head of the household. This was before he was midway through his teens. The pressure he was under must have been enormous. He held a salaried position at court, which demanded serious work. He was continuing instruction with Neefe. At home he was witnessing his father&#x2019;s increasing alcoholism and his mother&#x2019;s distress. This was made immeasurably worse by his mother&#x2019;s obviously declining health.

Uriarte enlisted in the United States Marine Corps in 2006 at the age of 19 and served for four years. During his first deployment to Iraq in 2007 he served as an MRAP turret gunner and dismount of India Company's "Jump" platoon in the Zaidon region southeast of Fallujah. He deployed to Iraq again in 2009 as a billeted Combat Photographer and Combat Artist, then enrolling in California College of the Arts. In 2010 Uriarte created the popular comic strip "Terminal Lance" while still on active duty. The strip is now published in <i>The Marine Corps Times</i> and has grown immensely in popularity."The Marine Corps likes to present itself with dutiful seriousness. <i>Terminal Lance</i> is a counterpoint to that.

As an Irish Symbolist, his work is analogous with that of his friends W.B. Yeats and George Russell (AE), as well as the early James Joyce. AE rightly prophesized the fascination his work would hold for future generations of collectors. Whether in stained glass or in book illustration, his all too rare work has, over the past two decades, become increasingly sought after. This book provides a chronological and contextual framework of study for his ceaseless and varied output&#x2014;in Dublin, London, the Aran Islands, Glasgow, Paris, and finally America. In Clarke, a fundamentally Arts and Crafts ideology is fused with a Celtic Revivalist spirit seeking expression in a modern idiom during a key period in Ireland's history.</p></p><p><b>Nicola Gordon Bowe</b> is an associate research fellow at&nbsp;a college of art and design.

Although commissioned in 1961 by American bishops to run a missionary training center in Cuernavaca, Mexico, Illich emerged as one of the major critics of the missionary movement. As he became a more controversial figure, his center evolved into CIDOC (Centro Intercultural de Documentaci�n), an informal university that attracted a diverse group of intellectuals and seekers from around the world. They came to Illich's center to learn Spanish, to attend seminars, and to sit at the feet of Illich, whose relentless criticism of the Catholic Church and modern Western culture resonated with the revolutionary spirit of the times. His 1967 article, "The Seamy Side of Charity," a harsh attack on the American missionary effort in Latin America, and other criticisms of the Church led to a trial at the Vatican in 1968, after which he left the priesthood. Illich's writings struck at the foundations of western society, and envisioned utopian transformations in the realms of education, transportation, medicine, and economics. He was an inspiration to a generation of liberation theologians and other left-wing intellectuals. <br><br>In<em> The Prophet of Cuernavaca</em> Todd Hartch traces the development of Illich's ideas from his work as a priest through his later secular period, offering one of the first book-length historical treatments of his thought in English.<br></p><p><br><strong>Todd Hartch</strong> is Professor of History, Eastern Kentucky University. He is the author of <em>The Rebirth of Latin American Christianity</em>.<br><br>"The book is at once disarmingly conversational and highly scholarly, a readable narrative and a rigorous analysis, a compelling story and a strong thesis about Illich s life work."--<em>International Journey of Christianity and Education</em><p></p><br>"Fair-minded and readable Readers finding themselves uncomfortable with all the available reform-revolution categories will find this appreciative yet critical Illich biography a good read."--<em>America Magazine</em><p></p><br>"Hartch s work on this controversial man is recommended to all academic libraries, especially those with Hispanic studies collections. Hartch has done an excellent job in keeping us aware of the tumultuous times in the 1960s and 1970s and those prophets like Illich."--<em>Catholic Library World</em><p></p><br>"Well researched and accessibly written, this is an important study of a major late-20th-century social critic." --<em>CHOICE</em> <br><p></p><br>"Hartch captures Illich's rare intellect and passion -- as well as his Catholic faith -- without succumbing to the ideological commentary that mars so many analyses of one of Western culture's most incisive social critics. I strongly recommend this book to young readers who seek an introduction to Illich, as well as to those like me who thought they already knew him." --Timothy Matovina, author of <em>Latino Catholicism: Transformation in America's Largest Church</em><p></p><br>"Illich was an enigmatic Catholic figure, a polymath who saw himself as a prophet of revolution. He viewed missionaries as tools of cultural occupation, saw schooling as detrimental to real education, and the medical system as harmful to health. Along the way he denounced the Church hierarchy as a betrayal of Christ, was suitably tried for heresy only to turn the tables on his inquisitors. Yet he left a large footprint that Hartch has traced with diligence and care." --Lamin Sanneh, author of <em>Disciples of All Nations: Pillars of World Christianity</em><p></p><br>"Todd Hartch, a prolific analyst of religious cultures and institutions of Latin America, provides a thoroughly original and engrossing interpretation of the life of Ivan Illich, one of the region's most provocative social thinkers of the second half of the twentieth century. By focusing on Illich's priestly calling, which endured long after he abandoned his public ministry, and by decoding the often-camouflaged theological underpinnings of Illich's thought and action, Hartch provides an illuminating portrait of one of the last century's most influential, yet misunderstood, critics of western modernity and the Catholic Church." --Gilbert M. Joseph, Farnam Professor of History and International Studies, Yale University<p></p><br>"Students of Latin American Christianity will be fruitfully provoked by their encounter with Illich through Hartch's work and contemporary readers of Illich now have a tremendous resource to turn to in trying to understand those events that precipitated his career as a social critic."-- <em>Studies in</em> <em>Religion</em> <br><p></p><br>"The great merit of this book is that it sheds light on an important chapter in the life of the church in the mid-twentieth century and on the role played by this still enigmatic figure." --<em>American Catholic Studies</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Adventures of Hershel of Ostropol</h2><p>Describes the life and experiences of wandering storyteller Hershel of Ostropol, who lived in what is now the Ukraine during the first part of the nineteenth century, and relates ten of his endearing stories.</p><p>Trina Schart Hyman received the Caldecott Medal for Saint George and the Dragon, retold by Margaret Hodges, and Caldecott Honor awards for A Child&#39;s Calendar by John Updike, Hershel and the Hanukkah Goblins by Eric A. Kimmel, and Little Red Riding Hood, which she retold herself. She lives in New Hampshire near her daughter, Katrin.Grade 5-9?Ten superbly retold Hershel of Ostropol tales, many of which are unavailable in popular collections. In "What Hershel's Father Did," Kimmel resurrects Hershel's reputation from that presented in Jacqueline D. Greene's What His Father Did (Houghton, 1992). "Money from a Table" and "The Candlesticks" are variations on a similar scheme: taking advantage of a miser's greed. "Potatoes!" is similar to Vicky Shiefman's Sunday Potatoes, Monday Potatoes (S.&amp;S, 1994); but where that version is sweet, Kimmel's is ironic. The funniest tale by far is "The Miracle," a commentary on the misplaced values of a community that has money to pay for a burial, but not for keeping a starving family alive. "An Incredible Story" and "The Cow" play out the tricky relationships between the Jews of Eastern Europe and their Christian neighbors, both nobles and peasants alike. "The Cow" is similar to Isaac Bashevis Singer's story of the goat that didn't give milk. A black-and-white vignette adorns each selection. The book closes with more of Hershel's sayings, redolent with Yiddish humor.?Marcia W.

Lion chasers don&#x2019;t run away; lion chasers run to the roar. They don&#x2019;t see a five-hundred- pound problem; they seize opportunity by the mane. They don&#x2019;t take flight; they fight to the death for their dreams.<br> &nbsp;<br> Buried in the second book of Samuel, the twenty-third chapter and the twentieth verse, is one of the most counterintuitive acts of courage in all of Scripture.

My life motto is encapsulated in its message&#x2014;<i>chase the lion.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> There was also Benaiah son of Jehoiada, a valiant warrior from Kabzeel. He did many heroic deeds, which included killing two champions of Moab. Another time, on a snowy day, he chased a lion down into a pit and killed it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Napoleon Bonaparte made a distinction &nbsp;between two kinds &nbsp;of courage&#x2014;<i>regular &nbsp;courage </i>and <i>two-o&#x2019;clock-in-the-morning courage. </i>&#x201c;The rarest attribute among Generals,&#x201d; said the Little Corporal, &#x201c;is two o&#x2019;clock- in-the-morning courage.&#x201d; <br><br> Chasing a lion into a pit on a snowy day takes two-o&#x2019;clock-in-the- morning courage. But that one act of courage completely changed the tra- jectory of Benaiah&#x2019;s life. The same is true of you. You are one idea, one risk, one decision away from a totally different life. Of course, it&#x2019;ll probably be the toughest decision you ever make, the scariest risk you ever take. But if your dream doesn&#x2019;t scare you, it&#x2019;s too small.<br> &nbsp;<br> Scripture doesn&#x2019;t explain what Benaiah was doing or where he was going when he crossed paths with the lion. We don&#x2019;t know the time of day or his frame of mind. But it does reveal his gut reaction, and it was gutsy.<br> &nbsp;<br> Put yourself in Benaiah&#x2019;s sandals.<br> &nbsp;<br> Your vision is obscured by falling snow and frozen breath. Out of the corner of your eye, you detect movement. Pupils dilate. Muscles flex. Adren- aline rushes. It&#x2019;s a prowling lion stalking its prey&#x2014;you.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the wild, man versus lion scripts the same way every time. Man runs; lion chases; king of the beasts eats manwich for lunch. But Benaiah flips the script. That&#x2019;s what courage does! I don&#x2019;t know if it was the look in his eye or the spear in his hand, but the lion turns tail and Benaiah gives chase.<br> &nbsp;<br> A fully grown lion can run thirty-six miles per hour and leap thirty feet in a single bound. Benaiah doesn&#x2019;t stand a chance, but that doesn&#x2019;t keep him from giving chase. He can&#x2019;t keep pace, but he can track paw prints in the freshly fallen snow. He comes to the place where the ground has given way beneath the lion&#x2019;s five-hundred-pound frame. Benaiah peers into the pit. Yellow cat eyes glare back.<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s a made-for-Hollywood moment. Imagine it on the silver screen. <br> &nbsp;<br> Benaiah walks away from the pit while moviegoers breathe a sigh of&nbsp;relief. But Benaiah isn&#x2019;t walking away; he&#x2019;s getting a running start. The audience gasps as Benaiah turns &nbsp;around and takes a flying leap of faith, disappearing into the darkness. A deafening roar echoes off the walls of the cavernous pit, followed by a bloodcurdling battle cry.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then silence, dead silence.<br> &nbsp;<br> No one is eating popcorn at this point.<br> &nbsp;<br> Everyone expects the lion to strut out, shaking its mane. But no. A&nbsp;human form reaches up and climbs out of the pit. Drops of blood color the&nbsp;snow crimson. Claw marks crisscross Benaiah&#x2019;s spear arm. But against all odds, the valiant warrior from Kabzeel earns an epic victory. <br>&nbsp;<br> Closing credits roll.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then, if I&#x2019;m producing the film, there is a postcredit scene like in the&nbsp;<i>Marvel </i>superhero movies&#x2014;Benaiah&#x2019;s cage fight with a giant Egyptian.<br><br><b>Chase the Lion</b><br> &nbsp;<br> If you find yourself in a pit with a lion on a snowy day, you&#x2019;ve got a problem. Probably the last problem you&#x2019;ll ever have! But you&#x2019;ve got to admit, &#x201c;I killed a lion in a pit on a snowy day&#x201d; looks awfully impressive on your r�sum�, es- pecially if you&#x2019;re applying for a bodyguard position with the king of Israel.<br> &nbsp;<br> Benaiah not only landed his dream job as King David&#x2019;s bodyguard, but his life exceeded his wildest dreams. Benaiah climbed the military chain of command all the way to the top, becoming commander in chief of Israel&#x2019;s army. The lion chaser became the most powerful person in the kingdom of Israel, save the king. But the genealogy of his dream traces back to a fight- or-flight moment. One decision determined his destiny. And not much has changed in the three millennia since then. You can run away from what you are afraid of, but you&#x2019;ll be running the rest of your life. It&#x2019;s time to face your fears, take a flying leap of faith, and chase the lion!<br> &nbsp;<br> In every dream journey there comes a moment when you have to quit living as if the purpose of life is to arrive safely at death. You have to go after a dream that is destined to fail without divine intervention.<br> &nbsp;<br> You have to go big or go home.<br> &nbsp;<br> You have to take the road less traveled or settle for status quo. <br> &nbsp;<br> You have to bite the bullet or turn your back on your dreams.<br> &nbsp;<br> I have a theory: <i>your favorite scripture will become the script of your life. </i>I take my cues from 2 Samuel 23:20. That script underscores who I want to be, what I want out of life, and what I believe about God. <i>Chase the lion </i>is more than a nice catch phrase; it&#x2019;s the metanarrative of my life.<br> &nbsp;<br> Most of us spend our lives running away from the things we&#x2019;re afraid of. We forfeit our dreams on the altar of fear. Or we chase after the wrong&nbsp;things. We&#x2019;re so busy climbing the ladder of success that we fail to realize it&#x2019;s leaning against the wrong wall. <br>&nbsp;<br> At the end of our lives, our greatest regrets will be the God-ordained opportunities we left on the table, the God-given passions we didn&#x2019;t pursue, and the God-sized dreams we didn&#x2019;t go after because we let fear dictate our decisions.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>No Guts, No Glory</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Most people believe God is real, but few people actually live like it. The re- sult is a widening gap between their theology and their reality. They allow their circumstances to get between them and God instead of letting God get between them and their circumstances. Lion chasers measure every- thing against almighty God, including five-hundred-pound &nbsp;lions. That&#x2019;s the difference between being a scaredy-cat and a lion chaser.<br> &nbsp;<br> When everything is said and done, God isn&#x2019;t going to say, &#x201c;Well said,&#x201d; &#x201c;Well thought,&#x201d; or &#x201c;Well planned.&#x201d; There is one measuring stick: &#x201c;Well done, good and faithful servant!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Faithfulness is not holding down the fort. <br> &nbsp;<br> Faithfulness is chasing five-hundred-pound lions.<br> &nbsp;<br> There is a brand of religiosity that seems satisfied with breaking even&#x2014; <i>don&#x2019;t do this, don&#x2019;t do that, and you&#x2019; ll be okay. </i>The problem with that is this: you can do nothing wrong and still do nothing right. Breaking even is breaking bad. God has called us to play offense with our lives. Those who simply run away from what&#x2019;s wrong will never amount to more than half Christians. The only way to tap your God-given potential, to fulfill your God-ordained &nbsp;destiny is to chase five-hundred-pound lions.<br> &nbsp;<br> God&#x2019;s dream for your life is so much bigger, so much better than break- ing even. If you focus on not making mistakes, you won&#x2019;t make a difference. You don&#x2019;t overcome sin by focusing on <i>not </i>sinning. You need a dream that is bigger and better than the temptations you&#x2019;re trying to overcome. You need a dream that doesn&#x2019;t allow you to become spiritually sidetracked, a dream that demands your utmost for His highest. <br>&nbsp;<br> There is an old aphorism: <i>No guts, no glory. </i>When we lack the guts to go after five-hundred-pound lions, we rob God of the glory He deserves. By definition, a God-sized dream will be beyond your ability, beyond your re- sources. Unless God does it, it can&#x2019;t be done! And that is precisely how God gets the glory. He does things we can&#x2019;t do so we can&#x2019;t take credit for them. God honors big dreams because big dreams honor God.<br> &nbsp;<br> Destiny is not a mystery. Destiny is a decision&#x2014;a difficult decision, a daring decision, a counterintuitive decision. You fulfill your destiny one op- portunity at a time. Of course, those opportunities often come disguised as five-hundred-pound problems. Landing in a pit with a lion on a snowy day qualifies as a bad day, a bad break. But Benaiah didn&#x2019;t see it as bad luck; he saw it as his big break.<br> &nbsp;<br> If you&#x2019;re looking for an excuse, you&#x2019;ll always find one.<br> &nbsp;<br> If you&#x2019;re looking for an opportunity, you&#x2019;ll always find one.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lion chasers have an eye for opportunity. There are amazing opportunities all around us all the time, but you have to see them to seize them. Then you need two-o&#x2019;clock-in-the-morning courage to chase them.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>The Genesis of a Dream</b><br> &nbsp;<br> When I was nineteen years old, I heard a sermon that would change the trajectory of my life. Sam Farina preached about a man named Benaiah, who chased a lion into a pit on a snowy day. I had never heard the story, and I could barely believe it was in the Bible. But a thought fired across my syn- apses: <i>If I ever write a book, I&#x2019; d like to write a book about that verse. </i>That was the genesis of a dream titled <i>In a Pit with a Lion on a Snowy Day.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> It would take sixteen years for that dream to become reality, and I al- most gave up on it a time or two. On October 16, 2006, <i>In a Pit </i>released with very little fanfare. In fact, it almost didn&#x2019;t see its second printing. But <i>In a Pit </i>beat the odds and inspired a generation of lion chasers to go after their dreams. Ten years later <i>In a Pit </i>has a sequel: <i>Chase the Lion.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;m often asked which of my books is my favorite. You might as well ask me which one of my children is my favorite! I love them all, but there is&nbsp;something unique about seeing your firstborn book on a bookshelf for the first time. <i>In a Pit </i>isn&#x2019;t my best-selling book, but if the measuring stick is life-altering decisions directly resulting from reading it, it might get the grand prize. It&#x2019;s been a game changer for lots of lion chasers, and I&#x2019;ll share some of their dream journeys in <i>Chase the Lion. </i>Their dreams are as different as they are, but each one has chased a lion in his or her own unique way. I hope their five-hundred-pound dreams inspire you as much as they have me. &nbsp;<br> In the prequel to this book, I focused exclusively on King David&#x2019;s body- guard, Benaiah. <i>Chase the Lion </i>is the rest of the story. Like Washington&#x2019;s inner circle or Lincoln&#x2019;s team of rivals, David&#x2019;s thirty-seven mighty men rank as a most remarkable band of brothers. They were insanely coura- geous, fiercely loyal. Their exploits would be unbelievable if they weren&#x2019;t recorded in Scripture. And without them, David&#x2019;s dream of becoming king would have died a fugitive&#x2019;s death.<br> &nbsp;<br> Our destiny is more intricately interwoven with others than any of us realize. The goal of <i>Chase the Lion </i>isn&#x2019;t simply to help you discover <i>your </i>dream. The best way to discover your dream is to help other people accom- plish theirs! That&#x2019;s what the mighty men did, and in so doing, their lives surpassed their wildest dreams.<br> &nbsp;<br> That&#x2019;s my prayer for you.<br> &nbsp;<br> May you discover <i>your God-sized </i>dream in the pages of this book, and may you have the courage to chase it. But your greatest legacy isn&#x2019;t your dream; it&#x2019;s the dreams you inspire in others! You aren&#x2019;t just a dreamer; you are a dreamcatcher.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;As you begin this dream journey, don&#x2019;t go it alone. Dreamers love com- pany! Chase the lion with a friend, a spouse, a mentor. Form a pride, just as lions do. Together you can accomplish far more than the sum total of your shared dreams. The God who is able to do immeasurably more than all you can ask will accomplish something way beyond what you can imagine,7 just as He did for David and his mighty men.<br> &nbsp;<br> And remember, if your dream doesn&#x2019;t scare you, it&#x2019;s too small.</p><h2>The House Sitter</h2><p>"Peter Lovesey loves strong women, cerebral killers and diabolical puzzles&#x2014;the very ingredients that make <i>The House Sitter</i> one of the most cunning mysteries in his Inspector Diamond series."&#x2014;Marilyn Stasio, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i> <br><br>"True wit is the hallmark of the classic British mystery, and Peter Lovesey delivers it, and a lot more in <i>The House Sitter</i>. . . .

They killed five demonstrators and wounded ten. All those killed were anti-racist community and labor leaders.<br><br><i>Love and Revolution: A Political Memoir</i> is both memoir and people's history. It is a factually detailed and passionate account of events surrounding the Greensboro Massacre by a woman intimately connected with the events. The author's husband, a pediatrician who abandoned medicine to work in a textile mill and organize low-wage workers, was among the slain.<br><br>The activists killed were from Christian, Jewish, African American, and Latino backgrounds; they were C�sar Cauce, Michael Nathan, M.D., William Sampson, Sandra Smith, and James Waller, M.D. All were in Greensboro that day on behalf of the Workers Viewpoint Organization (WVO), part of a New Communist Movement inspired by Marx, Lenin, and Mao Tse-Tung. As the Ku Klux Klan came out of the woodwork during a period of economic downturn in the late seventies, WVO activists took a militant stand against the Klan and its racism. <br><br>In the aftermath of Greensboro, survivors and concerned citizens faced an uphill battle for justice that eventually uncovered the involvement of official agencies in abetting the attack. At last, a 1985 civil suit found several of the attackers, as well as Greensboro police officers, liable for the wrongful death of Dr. Nathan.<br><br>The union organizing, the massacre, the coverup of official complicity, and the struggle for justice are all essential moments of this political memoir. Readers become acquainted with a neglected portion of recent U.S. history&#x2015;the South of the 1970s and 1980s&#x2015;and with lovers and revolutionaries who did not accept the established order and dared to struggle to change it. Waller explores the meaning and implications of the events for the survival of American democracy.</p><p><b>Signe Waller</b> was one of the organizers of the anti-Klan rally that turned into the Greensboro Massacre. Her husband, Dr. James Waller, and four close friends were killed in the massacre.Waller significantly adds to the historical record of a violent episode that took place in a city that long prided itself on its progressivism. . . . Intimate knowledge enables her to portray the slain demonstrators as real people cut down in their prime. <i>Love and Revolution</i> not only sheds light on what survivors call the Greensboro Massacre, but also illuminates how 88 seconds of gunfire that shook a housing project 24 years ago echo to this day. (<i>The Philadelphia Inquirer</i>)<br><br>This is a marvelous recounting of how the CWP managed to organize textile workers, not only in Greensboro but also throughout North Carolina. Recommended. (<i>CHOICE</i>)<br><br>Signe Waller's life exemplifies how the political and the personal are one. Her courage, her unflinching honesty, and her ability to look critically at herself, her beloved husband, her friends, and her enemies make this book essential reading. To understand what happened in Greensboro on November 3, 1979 is to understand a movement, a country, and a generation. Signe Waller has given us, through <i>Love and Revolution: A Political Memoir</i>, a rare gift. (Emily Mann, The McCarter Theatre, Princeton)<br><br>Signe Waller's perceptive biographical sketches in Love and Revolution rescue an important part of American history that is usually overlooked. Her work does for the social justice movements of the 1960s and after what the movie 'Reds' did for the revolutionary generation of the post-World War One era: it discloses what radicals and revolutionaries were fighting for and why they decided to follow that path in life. (Kenneth Robert Janken, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill)<br><br>Signe Waller's life personifies courageous political commitment and integrity. Her story represents an intimate and deeply moving portrayal of one person's struggle for justice. This extraordinary book speaks to the best in all of us. (Manning Marable, M. Moran Weston/Black Alumni Council Professor of African-American Studies, Columbia University)<br><br>For Signe and Jim Waller, the politics of social justice were never theoretical. Jim died for his principles, murdered by the Klan in November of 1979. In <i>Love and Revolution</i>, Signe relives these years with a vividness and generosity of spirit that make for both a magnificent memoir and an important chronicle of our time. (Fitzhugh Mullan, author of <i>White Coat, Clenched Fist: The Political Education of An American Physician<i>)<br><br>Signe Waller gives us in this moving memoir an important piece of the hidden history of our time. Her story tells us so much about our country, about things to be ashamed of, and about people to be proud of. (Howard Zinn, author of A People's History of the United States and professor emeritus of Political Science, Boston University)<br><br>This is an important look at a tragic moment in civil rights history&#x2015;almost written out of history and memory. But now a victim&#x2015;who refuses to be victimized&#x2015;has told the story. (Julian Bond, Chairman Emeritus, NAACP)<br><br>The fight-back after the Greensboro Massacre was a watershed in the struggle against racism. It became that because the widows and other victims refused to give up and organized effectively. I know of no instance where tragedy has been transformed so creatively. This book weaves together the personal and political so that we come to know the martyrs and survivors, who were part of that remarkable generation radicalized by the 1960s. They beleived passionately that they could change the world and&#x2015;although they made tactical mistakes&#x2015;succeeded for a time in uniting people of color and whites in struggle in one of the most repressive states in the south. (Anne Braden, Southern Organizing Committee for Economic and Social Justice)<br><br>A serious, complex, and important study of one of our city's most devastating, least understood events. Waller is able to zoom in and show what it was like to live through this searing and sorrowful event - seen now through the eyes of a woman who is older, wiser, and more circumspect thatn the strident propagandist of 20 years ago.

Their major adventure is the pursuit of the Zen way, which takes them climbing into the High Sierras to seek the lesson of solitude, a lesson that has a hard time surviving their forays into the pagan groves of San Francisco&#39;s Bohemia with its marathon wine-drinking bouts, poetry jam sessions, experiments in &#34;yabyum,&#34; and similar nonascetic pastimes. This autobiographical novel appeared just a year after the author&#39;s explosive On the Road put the Beat generation on the literary map and Kerouac on the bestseller lists. The same expansiveness, humor, and contagious zest for life that sparked the earlier novel ignites this one. The novel is based on Kerouac&#39;s experiences during the mid-1950s while living in California, after he&#39;d become interested in Buddhism&#39;s spiritual mode of understanding.

Others&#x2014;and I hope there are many, newcomers and Constant Readers alike&#x2014;may ask, <i>Can I read and enjoy this</i> <i>story if I haven&#x2019;t read the other Dark Tower books? </i>My answer is yes, if you keep a few things in mind. </p><p>First, Mid-World lies next to our world, and there are many overlaps. In some places there are doorways between the two worlds, and sometimes there are thin places, porous places, where the two worlds actually mingle. Three of Roland&#x2019;s ka-tet&#x2014;Eddie, Susannah, and Jake have been drawn separately from troubled lives in New York into Roland&#x2019;s Mid-World quest. Their fourth traveling companion, a billy-bumbler named Oy, is a golden-eyed creature native to Mid-World. Mid-World is very old, and falling to ruin, filled with monsters and untrustworthy magic. </p><p>Second, Roland Deschain of Gilead is a gunslinger&#x2014;one of a small band that tries to keep order in an increasingly lawless world. If you think of the gunslingers of Gilead as a strange combination of knights errant and territorial marshals in the Old West, you&#x2019;ll be close to the mark. Most of them, although not all, are descended from the line of the old White King, known as Arthur Eld (I told you there were overlaps).</p><p>Third, Roland has lived his life under a terrible curse. He killed his mother, who was having an affair&#x2014;mostly against her will, and certainly against her better judgment&#x2014;with a fellow you will meet in these pages. Although it was by mistake, he holds himself accountable, and the unhappy Gabrielle Deschain&#x2019;s death has haunted him since his young manhood. These events are fully narrated in the Dark Tower cycle, but for our purposes here, I think it&#x2019;s all you have to know. </p><p>For longtime readers, this book should be shelved between <i>Wizard</i> <i>and Glass </i>and <i>Wolves of the Calla </i>. . . which makes it, I suppose, <i>Dark Tower 4.5.</i></p><p>As for me, I was delighted to discover my old friends had a little more to say. It was a great gift to find them again, years after I thought their stories were told.</p><p>&#x2014;Stephen King</p><p>September 14, 2011</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>STARKBLAST</p><p>During the days after they left the Green Palace that wasn&#x2019;t Oz after all&#x2014;but which was now the tomb of the unpleasant fellow Roland&#x2019;s ka-tet had known as the Tick-Tock Man&#x2014;the boy Jake began to range farther and farther ahead of Roland, Eddie, and Susannah.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you worry about him?&#x201d; Susannah asked Roland. &#x201c;Out there on his own?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s got Oy with him,&#x201d; Eddie said, referring to the billy-bumbler who had adopted Jake as his special friend. &#x201c;Mr. Oy gets along with nice folks all right, but he&#x2019;s got a mouthful of sharp teeth for those who aren&#x2019;t so nice. As that guy Gasher found out to his sorrow.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Jake also has his father&#x2019;s gun,&#x201d; Roland said. &#x201c;And he knows how to use it. That he knows very well. And he won&#x2019;t leave the Path of the Beam.&#x201d; He pointed overhead with his reduced hand. The lowhanging sky was mostly still, but a single corridor of clouds moved</p><p>steadily southeast. Toward the land of Thunderclap, if the note left behind for them by the man who styled himself RF had told the truth.</p><p>Toward the Dark Tower.</p><p>&#x201c;But why&#x2014;&#x201d; Susannah began, and then her wheelchair hit a bump. She turned to Eddie. &#x201c;Watch where you&#x2019;re pushin me, sugar.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; Eddie said. &#x201c;Public Works hasn&#x2019;t been doing any maintenance along this stretch of the turnpike lately. Must be dealing with budget cuts.&#x201d;</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t a turnpike, but it <i>was </i>a road . . . or had been: two ghostly ruts with an occasional tumbledown shack to mark the way. Earlier that morning they had even passed an abandoned store with a barely readable sign: TOOK&#x2019;S OUTLAND MERCANTILE. They investigated inside for supplies&#x2014;Jake and Oy had still been with them then&#x2014;and had found nothing but dust, ancient cobwebs, and the skeleton of what had been either a large raccoon, a small dog, or a billy-bumbler. Oy had taken a cursory sniff and then pissed on the bones before leaving the store to sit on the hump in the middle of the old road with his squiggle of a tail curled around him. He faced back the way they had come, sniffing the air. </p><p>Roland had seen the bumbler do this several times lately, and although he had said nothing, he pondered it. Someone trailing them, maybe? He didn&#x2019;t actually believe this, but the bumbler&#x2019;s posture&#x2014;nose lifted, ears pricked, tail curled&#x2014;called up some old memory or association that he couldn&#x2019;t quite catch.</p><p>&#x201c;Why does Jake want to be on his own?&#x201d; Susannah asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you find it worrisome, Susannah of New York?&#x201d; Roland asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, Roland of Gilead, I find it <i>worrisome.</i>&#x201d; She smiled amiably enough, but in her eyes, the old mean light sparkled. That was the Detta Walker part of her, Roland reckoned. It would never be completely gone, and he wasn&#x2019;t sorry. Without the strange woman she had once been still buried in her heart like a chip of ice, she would have been only a handsome black woman with no legs below the knees. With Detta onboard, she was a person to be reckoned with. A dangerous one. A gunslinger.</p><p>&#x201c;He has plenty of stuff to think about,&#x201d; Eddie said quietly. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s been through a lot. Not every kid comes back from the dead. And it&#x2019;s like Roland says&#x2014;if someone tries to face him down, it&#x2019;s the someone who&#x2019;s apt to be sorry.&#x201d; Eddie stopped pushing the wheelchair, armed sweat from his brow, and looked at Roland. &#x201c;<i>Are </i>there someones in this particular suburb of nowhere, Roland? Or have they all moved on?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, there are a few, I wot.&#x201d;</p><p>He did more than wot; they had been peeked at several times as they continued their course along the Path of the Beam. Once by a frightened woman with her arms around two children and a babe hanging in a sling from her neck. Once by an old farmer, a half-mutie with a jerking tentacle that hung from one corner of his mouth. Eddie and Susannah had seen none of these people, or sensed the others that Roland felt sure had, from the safety of the woods and high grasses, marked their progress. Eddie and Susannah had a lot to learn. </p><p>But they had learned at least some of what they would need, it seemed, because Eddie now asked, &#x201c;Are they the ones Oy keeps scenting up behind us?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; Roland thought of adding that he was sure something else was on Oy&#x2019;s strange little bumbler mind, and decided not to. The gunslinger had spent long years with no ka-tet, and keeping his own counsel had become a habit. One he would have to break, if the tet was to remain strong. But not now, not this morning.</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s move on,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure we&#x2019;ll find Jake waiting for us up ahead.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Two hours later, just shy of noon, they breasted a rise and halted, looking down at a wide, slow-moving river, gray as pewter beneath the overcast sky. On the northwestern bank&#x2014;their side&#x2014;was a barnlike building painted a green so bright it seemed to yell into the muted day. Its mouth jutted out over the water on pilings painted a similar green. Docked to two of these pilings by thick hawsers was a large raft, easily ninety feet by ninety, painted in alternating stripes of red and yellow. A tall wooden pole that looked like a mast jutted from the center, but there was no sign of a sail. Several wicker chairs sat in front of it, facing the shore on their side of the river. Jake was seated in one of these. Next to him was an old man in a vast straw hat, baggy green pants, and longboots. On his top half he wore a thin white garment&#x2014;the kind of shirt Roland thought of as a slinkum. Jake and the old man appeared to be eating well-stuffed popkins. Roland&#x2019;s mouth sprang water at the sight of them.</p><p>Oy was beyond them, at the edge of the circus-painted raft, looking raptly down at his own reflection. Or perhaps at the reflection of the steel cable that ran overhead, spanning the river.</p><p>&#x201c;Is it the Whye?&#x201d; Susannah asked Roland.</p><p>&#x201c;Yar.&#x201d;</p><p>Eddie grinned. &#x201c;You say Whye; I say Whye Not?&#x201d; He raised one hand and waved it over his head. &#x201c;Jake! Hey, Jake! Oy!&#x201d; </p><p>Jake waved back, and although the river and the raft moored at its edge were still half a mile away, their eyes were uniformly sharp, and they saw the white of the boy&#x2019;s teeth as he grinned.</p><p>Susannah cupped her hands around her mouth. &#x201c;Oy! <i>Oy! </i>To me,</p><p>sugar! Come see your mama!&#x201d;</p><p>Uttering shrill yips that were the closest he could get to barks, Oy flew across the raft, disappeared into the barnlike structure, then emerged on their side. He came charging up the path with his ears lowered against his skull and his gold-ringed eyes bright.</p><p>&#x201c;Slow down, sug, you&#x2019;ll give yourself a heart attack!&#x201d; Susannah shouted, laughing.</p><p>Oy seemed to take this as an order to speed up. He arrived at Susannah&#x2019;s wheelchair in less than two minutes, jumped up into her lap, then jumped down again and looked at them cheerfully. &#x201c;Olan! Ed! Suze!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hile, Sir Throcken,&#x201d; Roland said, using the ancient word for bumbler he&#x2019;d first heard in a book read to him by his mother: <i>The</i> <i>Throcken and the Dragon.</i></p><p>Oy lifted his leg, watered a patch of grass, then faced back the way they had come, scenting at the air, eyes on the horizon. </p><p>&#x201c;Why does he keep doing that, Roland?&#x201d; Eddie asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; But he <i>almost </i>knew. Was it some old story, not The Throcken and the...</p></p><h2>Lords of the East: The East India Company and Its Ships (1600-1874)</h2><p>For nearly a century a massive Asian empire was administered by a privately owned company located half a world away. The turbulent story of England's Honourable East India Company and its rise to power is recounted in this lively and informative history of the company's past four hundred years. From 1600 to 1863 the East India Company prevailed against rival European companies and almost continual warfare to gradually win control of India and spearhead the Western penetration of China. The author goes beyond the company's commercial exploits, the scandals of the opium trade, and the stirring nineteenth-century Tea Clipper races to delve into the lives of its employees, East India's peculiar organizational structure, and the technical details of its ships, the lordly East Indiamen. She also covers the lesser-known aspects of the enterprise, such as the company's private navy, and its contribution to the development of early steam navigation. <p>Thoroughly researched, generously illustrated, and recently updated, this account reflects both the social and maritime history of the East India Company and its contributions to the expansion of the British Empire.</p></p><p></p><h2>Montgomery and the Eighth Army: A Selection from the Diaries, Correspondence and Other Papers of Field Marshal the Viscount Montgomery of Alamein (Army Record Society)</h2><p>Stephen Brooks has assembled a representative selection of Montgomery&#39;s pamphlets, letters and notes and set them in their historical context for what was to Monty the most satisfying period of his military career, from the Battle of El Alamein in 1942 to the planning of D-Day in December 1943.</p><p></p><h2>Agony in New Haven: The Trial of Bobby Seale, Ericka Huggins, and the Black Panther Party</h2><p>Book by Freed, Donald</p><p></p><h2>Aunt Dan and Lemon.</h2><p>Aunt Dan &amp; Lemon takes us into the world of a young recluse named Lemon (alias Leonora) who spends her nights reading chronicles of Nazi atrocities. Lemon tells the audience about the overwhelming influence in her life of her parents' friend "Aunt Dan," an eccentric, passionate professor whose stories and seductive opinions enthrall Lemon from the time she is a young girl. The relationship that develops between Lemon and Aunt Dan and the conversations that went on in a small house on the bottom of an English garden form the focus of this play about political orientation and the allure of certain ideas-even if they lead to murder. A forceful play exposing the banality of society's evil, Aunt Dan &amp; Lemon explores the ease with which good and bad become reconciled in the human mind.</p><p>Wallace Shawn's first play to be produced in New York was Our Late Night, directed by Andre Gregory at The Public Theater in 1975. A Thought in Three Parts was staged two years later by the Joint Stock Theatre Group in London, directed by Max Stafford-Clark. Shawn's next three plays - Marie and Bruce, Aunt Dan &amp; Lemon, and The Fever - were all performed in New York at the Public Theater and in London at the Royal Court. Aunt Dan and Lemon was revived in London in 1999 at the Almeida Theatre, directed by Tom Cairns. Shawn's next play, The Designated Mourner, premiered at the National Theatre, London, with Mike Nichols, Miranda Richardson, and David de Keyser under the direction of David Hare, and was then performed in New York by Wallace Shawn, Deborah Eisenberg, and Larry Pine under the direction of Andre Gregory. In 2009, the Royal Court held a Wallace Shawn season, reviving Aunt Dan and Lemon and The Fever, and staging the premiere of Grasses of a Thousand Colours. Shawn wrote the libretto for Allen Shawn's opera The Music Teacher, directed by Tom Cairns for The New Group in New York (2006). Shawn translated Brecht's The Threepenny Opera (performed in New York at the Roundabout, Studio 54, directed by Scott Elliott). Wallace Shawn and Andre Gregory wrote and performed in the film My Dinner with Andre and Andre Gregory directed Shawn in Vanya on 42nd Street. Shawn has appeared as an actor in many films, including Manhattan, Clueless, Scenes from the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills,The Moderns, and The Wife. Shawn's Essays was published by Haymarket Books in 2009.This current New York hit is about people who do not believe that human beings are capable of compassion. Stage action features the cold-blooded strangling of a client by a prostitute and monologues justifying the Holocaust and the bombing of Vietnam. In a lengthy afterword Shawn discusses how momentary lapses of logic can subtly undermine our moral sense, gradually creating an immoral world view. However, many readers may feel that the text of the play communicates the very attitudes that Shawn states he deplores. A dark, difficult, and extremely disturbing play.

Can spirituality be integrated with science? Is happiness possible? Do miracles really happen? Not only does The Visionary Window answer " yes" to all of these questions, but it skillfully combines the fields of philosophy, cosmology, religion, and psychology to form a new way of thinking about science and spirituality. Stepping beyond the classic work of prominent seventies physicist Fritjof Capra, Goswami details his own pioneering exploration of science and spirit, revealing the complete integration between modern science and spiritual traditions. Using stories and colorful examples from pop culture, Goswami addresses complex issues in language and terminology easily accessible to the lay reader. He provides quantum physics-based theory and new experimental data verifying the metaphysical truth that exists when employed in the context of a new science, science within the primacy of consciousness. With a new holistic worldview, Goswami also discusses the creativity of the body to self heal; the power of spiritual practice and how to choose a meditative path; and the five stages of spiritual growth, culminating in the ability to transcend the physical laws of nature. Readers, scientists and spiritual leaders alike will find answers to many of life&#x2019;s deepest mysteries.</p><p><b>Amit Goswami, Ph.D.</b>, was born in India and raised in the Hindu tradition. He earned his Ph.D. from Calcutta University in theoretical nuclear physics in 1964 and is professor emeritus in the physics department at the University of Oregon, in Eugene, Oregon, where he has served since 1968. He taught physics for 32 years in this country, mostly in Oregon, before fully retiring in 2003. Goswami was a senior scholar in residence at the Institute of Noetic Sciences during 1998-2000. He teaches quite regularly at the Holmes Institute and the Philosophical Research University in L.A.; Pacifica in Santa Barbara, CA; and UNIPAZ in Portugal. Goswami is a pioneer of the new multidisciplinary paradigm of science based on the primacy of consciousness called "Science within Consciousness," as well as the author of the highly successful textbook, <i>Quantum Mechanics</i>. His two-volume textbook for nonscientists, <i>The Physicist's View of Nature</i>, traces the decline and rediscovery of the concept of God within science. His research has been published in scientific journals in three different fields: physics, biology, and psychology. Goswami has also written eight popular books based on his research on quantum physics and consciousness. In his seminal book, <i>The Self-Aware Universe</i>, he solved the quantum measurement problem elucidating the famous observer effect while paving the path to a new paradigm of science based on the primacy of consciousness. Subsequently, in <i>The Visionary Window</i>, Goswami demonstrates how science and spirituality can be integrated. In <i>Physics of the Soul</i>, he developed a theory of survival after death and reincarnation. His book <i>Quantum Creativity</i> is a tour de force instruction about how to engage in both outer and inner creativity. Goswami's last book, <i>The Quantum Doctor</i>, integrates conventional and alternative medicines. In his private life, Goswami is a practitioner of spirituality and transformation. He refers to himself as a "quantum activist." The public knows Goswami perhaps the best since his leading role in the hit independent film, "What the Bleep Do We Know!?". He has also appeared on numerous radio talk shows, including "New Dimensions" and "Thinking Allowed". Goswami currently resides in Eugene, Oregon.</p><h2>The Antoine De Saint-Exupery Collection (The Little Prince / Airman&#39;s Odyssey)</h2><p>Used. Very Good conditions.

Estleman has been called &#34;the absolute best in the hard-boiled business&#34; (Philadelphia Inquirer). Since the appearance of his first novel in 1976, Estleman has published forty-two books, including the Detroit series and many historical westerns. He is best known for the Amos Walker mysteries that put him in &#34;the top eschelon of American private-eye specialists&#34; (New York Times). He is also the author of The Wister Trace, a critical study of twenty-nine classic Western novels. His pastiches pitting Sherlock Holmes against Dracula and Jekyll and Hyde have been continuously in print since their first appearances nearly twenty years ago. Estleman is an authority on both criminal history and the American West. He has been nominated for the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award and the Mystery Writers of America Edgar Award. He is the recipient of seven national writing awards, including three Shamuses from the Private Eye Writers of America and three Golden Spurs from the Western Writers of America. In 1987, the Michigan Foundation of the Arts presented him with its award for literature. In 1997, the Michigan Library Association named him the recipient of the Michigan Author&#39;s Award. Estleman has been a judge for many literary honors, including the prestigious Hopwood Award given by the University of Michigan. He has written book reviews for many newspapers, including the New York Times and the Washington Post. In 1988, he covered the filming of Lonesome Dove for TV Guide. Estleman&#39;s previous Amos Walker novel, Never Street, received starred reviews from both Publishers Weekly and Kirkus Reviews, had been featured in People as a &#34;Page Turner of the Week&#34;, and chosen by the New York Times Book Review as one of their &#34;Books of the Year&#34; for 1997. A sought-after speaker and a veteran journalist of police-beat news, Estleman graduated from Eastern Michigan University in 1974 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English Literature and Journalism. He lives in Michigan.Detroit in 1972 is in transition from Motor City to Murder City. The police undercover unit STRESS (Stop the Robberies, Enjoy Safe Streets) inadvertently makes things worse, angering the black community and upping the violence level. Reader Ezra Knight, who is equally at home with Shakespeare or gritty dialogue, follows several plot lines and characters as diverse as socialites and black activists. His rich, expressive voice never loses control of the story, even as the cops lose control of the city. Major players like Charlie Battle, the bright, young, black cop trying to make a bad situation better, and minor ones like Mapes, a cabby witness, are brought to life with humor and sensitivity. There are plenty of light moments, but this is, in essence, a dark tale.

In that bleak time, no one could have predicted the political upheaval awaiting Communist Europe and the city of Kafka and Rilke. Hampl's subsequent memoir, a brilliant evocation of Czech life under socialism, attained the stature of living history, and added to our understanding not only of Central Europe but also of what it means to be engaged in the struggle of a people to define and affirm themselves. Reissued now, during the tenth anniversary of that astonishing upheaval known as the Velvet Revolution, <em>A Romantic Education</em> includes an extensive updated afterword based on Hampl's annual return trips to Prague and the Czech countryside. Here is an excellent introduction to what was once the unknown "other Europe" behind the Iron Curtain and is now the continent's hottest new travel destination. Once again, as she did in a darker time, Hampl sees the texture beneath the surface of things and intuits the changing life of one of Europe's most bewitching cities. <em>A Romantic Education</em> is an exquisite journey into history and into the conundrum of personal memory</p><p>Patricia Hampl, Regents&#39; Professor at the University of Minnesota, lives in St. Paul.Hampl adds a new afterword to this 1981 memoir/travelogue about her ancestral home, Prague, based on her 1991 return visit. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>German Commerce Raider vs British Cruiser: The Atlantic &amp; The Pacific 1941 (Duel)</h2><p>During World War II, the Kriegsmarine armed a number of merchant vessels with concealed guns and torpedo tubes for surprise attacks against Allied shipping.

She said her name was Violet and she was my&nbsp;biggest fan.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She looked Hispanic, no older than twenty. She had darkblue&nbsp;eyeliner drawn in a kind of Egyptian curl at the edges of her&nbsp;sad, serious eyes. She was standing at the foot of the escalator&nbsp;holding a cheery hand-drawn sign with my name spelled out in magic-markered rainbows. I couldn&#x2019;t have missed it even if she&nbsp;hadn&#x2019;t started jumping up and down and waving it with one&nbsp;hand as soon as my face appeared on the arrivals level above. I&nbsp;was wearing sunglasses and had slung over my shoulder a beatup&nbsp;bike messenger bag filled with art supplies, toiletries, and a&nbsp;single change of clothes. I carried a small, flat, black portfolio of&nbsp;original art from my comic books.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With my free hand I reached out to shake hers when I&nbsp;stepped off the escalator. &#x201c;The con sent you?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She had to shove the sign under her armpit to take my hand,&nbsp;which was when I realized that she had no left arm&#x2014;or rather,&nbsp;her left arm stopped just above what would have been her elbow.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I am so very very happy to meet you! My name is Violet&#x2014;as you can see! Violent Violet.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I put two and two together finally and her outfit clicked.&nbsp;She was wearing a leather aviator helmet and from her belt jangled&nbsp;a riot of prosthetic arms&#x2014;one ending in a claw, another&nbsp;in a popgun, another in a weed whacker&#x2014;just like Violent Violet,&nbsp;one of the main characters from the indie comic book I&nbsp;made my bones on, <i>Gut Check</i>, a post-apocalyptic pro-wrestling&nbsp;action-drama-romance about the titular hero, an American who&nbsp;travels to Edo to learn sumo wrestling and goes on to become a&nbsp;superstar on the televised wrestling circuit before finding himself&nbsp;enlisted in an ancient war against demonic <i>luchadores</i> to prevent&nbsp;the Mayan end-of-days&#x2014;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yeah, the one the movie is based on, right.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yeah, they had me on set to help out a little bit.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No, I&#x2014;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hey, listen, is it cool if we not talk about the movie? Or&nbsp;maybe save it until I get through my whole statement? Because&nbsp;it&#x2019;s kind of on the long side.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anyway, like the girl picking me up at the airport, the comics&nbsp;version of Violent Violet&#x2014;Gut Check&#x2019;s love interest&#x2014;is a&nbsp;one-armed warrior who wrestles using her wide variety of prosthetic&nbsp;limbs or, from time to time, with none at all, just to prove&nbsp;she requires no technological enhancement to kick your dumb&nbsp;ableist ass.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;She is my favorite, and <i>you&#x2019;re</i> my favorite, I mean, seriously,&nbsp;you are my favorite artist of all time, I love <i>Gut Check</i>, I love&nbsp;the comic, I love the movie, I love your amazing run on <i>Mister</i><br><i> Mystery</i>, I mean, I love everything you do.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I greet all praise with suspicion and believe every horrible&nbsp;thing ever said about me a hundredfold, so I just smiled vaguely&nbsp;and nodded, more in acknowledgment than agreement. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s&nbsp;really nice of you to say, thanks. Thanks for volunteering for the&nbsp;con, that&#x2019;s really cool of you.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Yeah, no problem. Anything you need, I&#x2019;m gonna get you.&nbsp;I am, like, going to be right by your Artists&#x2019; Alley table at the&nbsp;con, you need me to go get you food, you need me to bring water,&nbsp;you need me to sit at your booth while you go to the men&#x2019;s&nbsp;room, whatever you need, all of Comic-Con, I am going to be&nbsp;your sidekick, I am there for you, all the way, 24/7.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She said all of that without taking a single breath. I couldn&#x2019;t&nbsp;tell if she was on something or just naturally had the metabolism&nbsp;of a hummingbird. I didn&#x2019;t really mind one way or another.&nbsp;I&#x2019;d seen worse. One time, I agreed to do what I was told was a&nbsp;quote-unquote small convention in Eugene, Oregon. I flew in,&nbsp;the owner of the local comic book store picked me up and took&nbsp;me to the quote-unquote show. Not to a convention center, not&nbsp;to a hotel ballroom, not even to his shop, but to the basement of&nbsp;his house, which was lined with framed copies of my comics and&nbsp;some of my original art he had bought online. There was no one&nbsp;else there except these two big, quiet white dudes. After we had&nbsp;been down there for a couple hours, hanging out, drinking beers&nbsp;and eating pizza, I realized, looking into the guy&#x2019;s eyes, that wait,&nbsp;there is no con. <i>This</i> is the con. He just wanted to meet me and&nbsp;have me hang out with him and his buddies.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once you get through a weekend like that without anybody&nbsp;wearing your skin for a hat, the Violent Violets of the world&nbsp;seem fairly normal.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I love it,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Lead on.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Catching a ride from the airport with one of my own characters&nbsp;would ordinarily qualify as strange, except that fiction&nbsp;starts devouring reality pretty much as soon as you step off the&nbsp;plane at San Diego International Airport during the week of&nbsp;Comic-Con. The escalators leading down to baggage claim had&nbsp;been covered in vinyl and made to look like on- and off-ramps&nbsp;ferrying you into and out of the bowels of a massive gray spaceship:&nbsp;Up was labeled To Abduction and down was labeled Post&nbsp;Abduction. The baggage kiosks had been skinned to look like&nbsp;spinning UFOs. The whole thing was promoting some new extraterrestrial&nbsp;romance streaming on Netflix in two weeks.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I followed Violent Violet through the automatic glass doors&nbsp;of the terminal. The weather in San Diego was, per usual, insultingly&nbsp;perfect: cool, blue skies, a vague sweetness in the air.&nbsp;Across the palm-lined taxi stand was a squat concrete parking&nbsp;garage where we found her candy-colored Toyota Corolla.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I have to warn you,&#x201d; she said, holding up her hand before&nbsp;getting inside, &#x201c;the interior of my car is a reflection of my internal&nbsp;psyche.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I opened the passenger door to find what would have been&nbsp;my seat covered in In-N-Out Burger cartons, an empty Coke&nbsp;Zero bottle, and a half-eaten bag of Smartfood, among other&nbsp;dorm-room detritus.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Oh, shit, shit, sorry, sorry.&#x201d; She reached across from the&nbsp;driver&#x2019;s side and swept the garbage onto the floor of the car. &#x201c;I&nbsp;was going to do that before coming to meet you but I was so&nbsp;excited and my brain just started racing and&#x2014;<i>brrrruuuggghhh!</i>&#x201d;&nbsp;She mimed an EMP explosion mushrooming out of her cranium,&nbsp;or at least that&#x2019;s what I assumed it was.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Believe me, I&#x2019;ve been there.&#x201d; I got in the car, keeping my&nbsp;bags in my lap. My shoe soles settled atop the pile of garbage&nbsp;with an audible crunch.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Violent Violet maneuvered us out of the airport&#x2019;s pretzeled&nbsp;traffic. The car had an automatic transmission, unsurprisingly,&nbsp;and she only ever took her one hand off the steering to use her&nbsp;turn signal, at which point she leaned forward ever so slightly to&nbsp;brace the wheel with the tip of her stump. It looked like the most&nbsp;natural thing in the world.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;There is one thing I should probably tell you, though,&#x201d; she&nbsp;said once we got on the highway, and took a deep breath.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before she could say more I interjected:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Actually, real quick, if you&#x2019;re serious about being my&nbsp;helper, I&#x2019;ve got a mission for you.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I accept it. I pledge my honor and my life to its completion!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;You are officially my hero. Thank you. There&#x2019;s this&nbsp;self-storage place, A1 U-Store, off I-5? I need you to go into my&nbsp;unit, it&#x2019;s number 616, and grab my banner, a FedEx box filled&nbsp;with prints, and a small suitcase and bring them to me at my&nbsp;table, okay?&#x201d; I wrote the address on a Starbucks receipt I found&nbsp;in my pocket and put that plus the key on the dashboard where&nbsp;Violent Violet could see them. &#x201c;Normally I&#x2019;d do this myself, but&nbsp;I want to make it to my table before preview night ends.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Oh . . . kay.&#x201d; She frowned, puzzled. &#x201c;You keep that stuff&nbsp;here when you&#x2019;re not in town?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Yeah, I have storage units all over the country. Charlotte,&nbsp;Chicago, Seattle, Orlando. Wherever the big comic cons are.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t keep them at home?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;This is my home.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Pardon?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I gave up my house three years ago. Now I live entirely at&nbsp;cons. They fly me out, put me up in hotels, and I go to my Artists&#x2019;&nbsp;Alley table and draw sketches for people, and then another con&nbsp;flies me somewhere else. I just ask them to extend my stay past&nbsp;the weekend in either direction, instead of an appearance fee.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;So you were just coming from another con when you arrived&nbsp;here?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Yeah, a small one, in Cleveland. There was a ballroom&nbsp;dancing competition and a brewers&#x2019; convention going on in the&nbsp;same hotel, which made for some interesting conversations at<br> the breakfast buffet.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;You . . . live at comic book conventions.&#x201d; Violent Violet&nbsp;blinked. &#x201c;Is that really, really awesome . . . or really, really sad?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I said with conviction.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Violent Violet didn&#x2019;t say anything, she just drove.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I store my prints in the unit because they can get completely&nbsp;destroyed on flights, either in the overhead bins or from&nbsp;the barbarians in baggage handling. And I scatter changes of&nbsp;clothes everywhere because I find doing laundry in hotels super&nbsp;depressing.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;And another thing, Violet, if you&#x2019;d be so kind. If you see&nbsp;me trying to talk to my ex-wife, or call her, or wave her over&nbsp;to me, I need you to take that arm on your belt with the spike&nbsp;on the end and ram it directly through my eyeball and into my&nbsp;brain. If you could do that for me, I&#x2019;d really appreciate it.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I, uh . . . &#x201d; She swallowed. I met her five minutes ago and&nbsp;already discovered the limits of her devotion. I excel at that. &#x201c;I&nbsp;don&#x2019;t really know what your ex-wife looks like, though? Besides,<br>all my weapons are Styrofoam.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Ah, well. My loss.&#x201d; I looked out the window. The Corolla&nbsp;was winging its way toward downtown, a modest row of skyscrapers&nbsp;rising up beyond a harbor dotted with sailboats and&nbsp;U.S. Navy warships. &#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t even going to come to this show&nbsp;when I heard through the grapevine she was going to be here&nbsp;too. For the first time in three years, we&#x2019;re going to be in close&nbsp;physical proximity to each other, like matter and antimatter.&nbsp;That&#x2019;s dangerous stuff. Like, <i>cosmically</i> dangerous.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Why&#x2019;d you change your mind?&#x201d; Violent Violet&#x2019;s voice had&nbsp;softened to a peep.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;The committee that runs the Kirby Awards asked me to&nbsp;give a lifetime achievement award to Benjamin Kurtz&#x2014;you&nbsp;know, Ben K, the creator of Mister Mystery? He&#x2019;s like my oldest&nbsp;friend and mentor in this business, so I couldn&#x2019;t say no.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; She practically swallowed the word.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Oh?&#x201d; I turned to her with a frown. &#x201c;Oh, what oh?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After a moment&#x2019;s hesitation she said:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t seen Twitter?&#x201d;</p><h2>The UFO Hunter&#39;s Handbook (Field Guides to Paranormal)</h2><p>This guide for the UFO hunter is chock-full of all the information you&#39;ll need to become a skilled hunter of all things paranormal.

John lives with his family in Indianapolis, Indiana.<b>(one)</b><p>The morning after noted child prodigy Colin Singleton graduated fromhigh school and got dumped for the nineteenth time by a girl named Katherine,he took a bath. Colin had always preferred baths; one of his general policiesin life was never to do anything standing up that could just as easily bedone lying down. He climbed into the tub as soon as the water got hot, andhe sat and watched with a curiously blank look on his face as the water overtookhim. The water inched up his legs, which were crossed and folded intothe tub. He did recognize, albeit faintly, that he was too long, and too big, forthis bathtub&#x2014;he looked like a mostly grown person playing at being a kid.As the water began to splash over his skinny but unmuscled stomach,he thought of Archimedes. When Colin was about four, he read a bookabout Archimedes, the Greek philosopher who&#x2019;d discovered that volumecould be measured by water displacement when he sat down in the bathtub.Upon making this discovery, Archimedes supposedly shouted &#x201c;Eureka!&#x201d;[1] and then ran naked through the streets. The book said that manyimportant discoveries contained a &#x201c;Eureka moment.&#x201d; And even then, Colinvery much wanted to have some important discoveries, so he asked hismom about it when she got home that evening.</p><p>&#x201c;Mommy, am I ever going to have a Eureka moment?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, sweetie,&#x201d; she said, taking his hand. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I wanna have a <i>Eureka Moment,</i>&#x201d; he said, the way another kid mighthave expressed longing for a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle.</p><p>She pressed the back of her hand to his cheek and smiled, her face soclose to his that he could smell coffee and makeup. &#x201c;Of course, Colin baby.Of course you will.&#x201d;</p><p>But mothers lie. It&#x2019;s in the job description.</p><p>Colin took a deep breath and slid down, immersing his head. <i>I am crying,</i> hethought, opening his eyes to stare through the soapy, stinging water. <i>I feellike crying, so I must be crying, but it&#x2019;s impossible to tell because I&#x2019;m underwater.</i>But he wasn&#x2019;t crying. Curiously, he felt too depressed to cry. Too hurt.It felt as if she&#x2019;d taken the part of him that cried.</p><p>He opened the drain in the tub, stood up, toweled off, and got dressed.When he exited the bathroom, his parents were sitting together on his bed.It was never a good sign when both his parents were in his room at the sametime. Over the years it had meant:</p><p>1. Your grandmother/grandfather/Aunt-Suzie-whom-you-never-met-but-trust-me-she-was-nice-and-it&#x2019;s-a-shame is dead.</p><p>2. You&#x2019;re letting a girl named Katherine distract you from your studies.</p><p>3. Babies are made through an act that you will eventually find intriguingbut for right now will just sort of horrify you, and also sometimespeople do stuff that involves baby-making parts that does not actuallyinvolve making babies, like for instance kiss each other in placesthat are not on the face.</p><p>It never meant:</p><p>4. A girl named Katherine called while you were in the bathtub. She&#x2019;ssorry. She still loves you and has made a terrible mistake and is waitingfor you downstairs.</p><p>But even so, Colin couldn&#x2019;t help but hope that his parents were in the roomto provide news of the Number 4 variety. He was a generally pessimistic person,but he seemed to make an exception for Katherines: he always felt theywould come back to him. The feeling of loving her and being loved by herwelled up in him, and he could taste the adrenaline in the back of histhroat, and maybe it wasn&#x2019;t over, and maybe he could feel her hand in hisagain and hear her loud, brash voice contort itself into a whisper to sayI-love-you in the very quick and quiet way that she had always said it. Shesaid <i>I love you</i> as if it were a secret, and an immense one.</p><p>His dad stood up and stepped toward him. &#x201c;Katherine called my cell,&#x201d;he said. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s worried about you.&#x201d; Colin felt his dad&#x2019;s hand on his shoulder,and then they both moved forward, and then they were hugging.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re very concerned,&#x201d; his mom said. She was a small woman withcurly brown hair that had one single shock of white toward the front. &#x201c;Andstunned,&#x201d; she added. &#x201c;What happened?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Colin said softly into his dad&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s just&#x2014;she&#x2019;d had enough of me. She got tired. That&#x2019;s what she said.&#x201d; And then hismom got up and there was a lot of hugging, arms everywhere, and his momwas crying. Colin extricated himself from the hugs and sat down on his bed.He felt a tremendous need to get them out of his room immediately, like ifthey didn&#x2019;t leave he would blow up. Literally. Guts on the walls; his prodigiousbrain emptied out onto his bedspread.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, at some point we need to sit down and assess your options,&#x201d; hisdad said. His dad was big on assessing. &#x201c;Not to look for silver linings, but itseems like you&#x2019;ll now have some free time this summer. A summer class atNorthwestern, maybe?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I really need to be alone, just for today,&#x201d; Colin answered, trying to conveya sense of calm so that they would leave and he wouldn&#x2019;t blow up. &#x201c;Socan we assess tomorrow?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course, sweetie,&#x201d; his mom said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be here all day. You justcome down whenever you want and we love you and you&#x2019;re so so special,Colin, and you can&#x2019;t possibly let this girl make you think otherwise becauseyou are the most magnificent, brilliant boy&#x2014;&#x201d; And right then, the mostspecial, magnificent, brilliant boy bolted into his bathroom and puked hisguts out. An explosion, sort of.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, Colin!&#x201d; shouted his mom.</p><p>&#x201c;I just need to be alone,&#x201d; Colin insisted from the bathroom. &#x201c;Please.&#x201d;When he came out, they were gone.</p><p>For the next fourteen hours without pausing to eat or drink or throw upagain, Colin read and reread his yearbook, which he had received just fourdays before. Aside from the usual yearbook crap, it contained seventy-twosignatures. Twelve were just signatures, fifty-six cited his intelligence,twenty-five said they wished they&#x2019;d known him better, eleven said it was funto have him in English class, seven included the words &#x201c;pupillary sphincter,&#x201d;[2] and a stunning <i>seventeen</i> ended, &#x201c;Stay Cool!&#x201d; Colin Singleton couldno more <i>stay</i> cool than a blue whale could <i>stay</i>skinny or Bangladesh could<i>stay</i>rich. Presumably, those seventeen people were kidding. He mulled thisover&#x2014;and considered how twenty-five of his classmates, some of whomhe&#x2019;d been attending school with for twelve years, could possibly havewanted to &#x201c;know him better.&#x201d; As if they hadn&#x2019;t had a chance.</p><p>But mostly for those fourteen hours, he read and reread KatherineXIX&#x2019;s inscription:</p><p>Col,</p><p>Here&#x2019;s to all the places we went. And all the places we&#x2019;ll go. Andhere&#x2019;s me, whispering again and again and again and again:iloveyou.</p><p>yrs forever, K-a-t-h-e-r-i-n-e</p><p>Eventually, he found the bed too comfortable for his state of mind, so he laydown on his back, his legs sprawled across the carpet. He anagrammed &#x201c;yrsforever&#x201d; until he found one he liked: <i>sorry fever.</i> And then he lay there in hisfever of sorry and repeated the now memorized note in his head and wantedto cry, but instead he only felt this aching behind his solar plexus. Crying<i>adds</i> something: crying is you, plus tears. But the feeling Colin had wassome horrible opposite of crying. It was you, minus something. He keptthinking about one word&#x2014;forever&#x2014;and felt the burning ache just beneathhis rib cage.It hurt like the worst ass-kicking he&#x2019;d ever gotten.

Archie Bray envisioned his pottery as a place where young artists could use the brickyard's clays and kilns, hone their skills, learn from each other, and develop a sensibility about the Foundation's signature production ware. In 1951, Peter Voulkos and Rudy Autio became the Bray's first two resident artists. By the start of the 1960s, they had accomplished a revolution in the concept of ceramic art. A series of resident directors, themselves artists, have overseen the development and expansion of the Bray Foundation's programs and workshops. An ever-increasing number of young artists continue to find support and inspiration there, largely because of the three rugged individualists who gave it life and impetus. "It is a place," writes curator Peter Held, "where people come of age, finding a niche in the centuries-old continuum of the ceramic arts." <p>"You get notorious when you start a pottery in the middle of the wilderness," Peter Meloy reflected, looking back on his own backyard pottery beginnings in Helena, Montana, in the late 1940s. Meloy went on to a career in law but remained actively connected with the arts, as did Branson Stevenson of Great Falls, a versatile artist and businessman. They became two of the three original board members of the Archie Bray Foundation for the Ceramic Arts. The other member and founder, Archie Bray, owned a brickyard that, even if at first notorious in its western isolation, became the nexus of contemporary ceramics in America. </p><p>This fiftieth anniversary publication offers a history of the Archie Bray Foundation, an evaluation of its accomplishments, and a discussion of 85 works selected from more than 800 in the Bray collection. Through interviews with artists, resident directors, workshop presenters, and the late Peter Meloy, and drawing on the resources of the Foundation's archives, Rick Newby and Chere Jiusto present its always lively, occasionally conflicted, and unfailingly interesting history through the voices and letters of those who knew it best. Art historian Patricia Failing considers the aesthetic and intellectual influences of the Bray experience upon artists who worked there, and on their later work. She examines the profound effects that a seminal workshop of 1952, presented by legendary potters Bernard Leach, Shoji Hamada, and Soetsu Yanagi, had upon the Bray's resident potters, and subsequently on the entire concept of ceramic art in America. Art critic and writer Janet Koplos discusses the unique circumstances that gave rise to the Bray collection and gives a close reading of the 85 objects selected for the book. <i>A Ceramic Continuum</i> also includes a listing of all Archie Bray Foundation resident directors and artists and of workshop presenters over the years.</p></p><p>Peter Held is executive director and chief curator of the Holter Museum of Art in Helena, Montana.</p><h2>Memily (Serendipity)</h2><p>The other jungle animals make Memily the giraffe self-conscious about her size, until a meeting with another giraffe convinces her that she is just right for the kind of animal she is</p><p></p><h2>The Player</h2><p>Set in Hollywood, this ultimate Hollywood novel takes readers into the eerie emptiness of Tinseltown and defines the machinery of moviedom. Reissue. Movie tie-in.</p><p>"Just as Griffin suspected, there was a meeting in Levison's office without him." With this opening, we are taken into the mind and life of Griffin Mill, senior vice president of production at a major Hollywood studio. It is a mind full of paranoia, duplicity, and guile--and a life full of money, power, and fame. It is the movie business. <p>Griffin Mill is ruthlessly ambitious, driven to control the levers of America's dream-making machinery. Griffin listens to writers pitch him stories all day, sitting in judgment on their fantasies, their lives. But now one writer to whose pitch he responded so glibly is sending him postcards: "You said you'd get back to me. You didn't. And now in the name of all writers who get pushed around by studio executives I'm going to kill you." </p><p>Squeezed between the threat to his life and the threat to his job, Griffin's deliberate and horrifying response spins him into a nightmare. Then he meets the sad and beautiful June Mercator and his obsession for her threatens to destroy them both. </p><p>With a compulsively readable narrative that offers a devastating portrait of contemporary Hollywood--the studio execs, the deal-making, the politics, the pitches--The Player is the smartest book about Hollywood since What Makes Sammy Run? and the most sinister since The Day of the Locust.

Anyone who has some connection to the film industry should get a big, knowing kick from the book and never be able to look at a studio executive in quite the same light again.

The batter can track the ball until it is about five feet in front of the plate, but then he falls behind because the ball is moving too fast. <br><br>In <i>Keep Your Eye on the Ball</i>, Robert G. Watts and A. Terry Bahill--engineers by vocation, baseball fans by avocation--have devised a series of experiments that put some of baseball's most cherished myths to the test. By applying physics, psychology, physiology, and other scientific principles to baseball, the authors have resolved, once and for all, some of the controversial issues that have intrigued fans for decades, including: <br><br>* Do curveballs really curve? Do fastballs rise? <br>* How do knuckleballs and spitballs work? <br>* What exactly happens when the ball hits the bat? <br>* Does corking the bat really help a hitter? <br>* Are aluminum bats more dangerous than wooden bats? <br>* Can certain physiological factors help predict success for a hitter? <br>* Why are more home runs being hit than ever before? <br>* Are today's players better than yesterday's? <br><br>Completely revised and updated to include recent statistics, new research, and additional historical commentary, <i>Keep Your Eye on the Ball </i>is a highly informative and entertaining guide to the science of baseball that all fans of the game--regardless of scientific background--will enjoy. <br><br></p><p><br>Robert G. Watts teaches in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Tulane University. Having more than a mere theoretical interest in the game, he pitched as a young man for the semiprofessional Bayou Latanache Baseball Club--where he gained first-hand knowledge of spitballs, fly balls, and a healthy familiarity with insider-baseball lore. <br><br>A. Terry Bahill has been Professor of Systems Engineering at the University of Arizona in Tucson since 1984. He has been investigating the brain's motor functions since 1971. Actively pursuing experiments in the science of baseball for many years, he has developed a measuring device that strengthens a player's ability to follow the pitch, as well as the Bat Chooser, a system that computes the Ideal Bat Weight for individual hitters. <br><br>"Engagingly written" -- <i>Sacramento Bee</i><br><br>"New get your calculators and slide rules handy.

Enraged, the Ravenette government and nine neighboring planets form a coalition, and their first act of secession is to overrun Ravenette&#x2019;s Confederation garrison. With the armed forces of ten worlds seizing the brutal upper hand, the embattled troops need help&#x2014;now&#x2014;and they need it bad.<br><br> Enter the Marines of the 34th FIST.

Throughout two thirds of this continent, the cry of "The Iroquois are coming!" was enough to demoralize entire tribes. But these Iroquois occupied and controlled a vast wilderness empire which beckoned like a precious gem to foreign powers. France and England secured toeholds and suddenly each was claiming as its own this land of the Iroquois. Alliance with the Indians was the key; whichever power controlled them could destroy the other. <p>Wilderness Empire is the gripping narrative of the eighteenth-century struggle of these two powers to win for themselves the allegiance of the Indians in a war for territorial dominance, yet without letting these Indians know that the prize of the war would be this very Iroquois land. It is the story of English strength hamstrung by incredible incompetence, of French power sapped by devastating corruption. It is the story of the English, Indian and French individuals whose lives intertwine in the greatest territorial struggle in American history--the French and Indian War.</p></p><p>Allan Eckert has molded the raw facts of history into a moving, perceptive and penetrating narrative filled with the grace and pathos, action and beauty, humanity and savagery of which survival on the American frontier was all a part.

Her essays have recently appeared in The Best Creative Nonfiction and the Touchstone Anthology of Contemporary Nonfiction as well as in The Believer, Gulf Coast, Columbia, Ninth Letter, the North American Review, the Bellingham Review, the Seneca Review, and Harper&#39;s.Biss' slender debut collection is as spare as a Japanese watercolor. Her narrative prose poems limn, via a series of interwoven subjects and themes, the story of a family, complete with a cast of characters and time lines, a tale that, by extension, transcends into the universal. A stunning opening example is the juxtaposition of the mother's amazement that more people don't commit suicide because of the difficulties of living with snippets from a news item reporting a plane crash that focuses on the retrieval and use of the Black Box (actually bright orange), or cockpit voice recorder. Prior to the transcript's release, the National Transportation Safety Board deletes all emotional material, leaving only materials "useful to the public." So too with family histories, Biss suggests in her austere yet sure and evocative poems. Interwoven with swift images of brightly lit, high-ceilinged supermarkets are recollections of a six-year-old crush and fragments of dreams, creating an oddly engaging mosaic. <i>Whitney Scott</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

No one, that is, except unborn twins jostling for space in the womb. In this concise and inventive novel, a twin brother and sister vie for attention from the reader much as they competed for room before their birth. Their prenatal intimacy and jealousy interlace until they can hardly recognize who is who.&nbsp;The chaos originating at the very moment of the twins&#x2019; conception gains dramatic proportions when they enter the world male and female. From the moment of their births, everything changes. The lives of the family members begin to unwind as they are each consumed by illness, obsession, and insanity. The inevitable and violent dissolution of the family becomes a metaphor in which Diamela Eltit explores the social crises in Chile during the military dictatorship of General Cesare Augusto Pinochet.&nbsp;Born in Santiago, Chile, in 1949, Diamela Eltit now makes her home in Mexico as Chile&#x2019;s cultural attach�. <i>The Fourth World</i>, first published in 1988, is her third novel. While other Chilean writers fled the military dictatorship that began in 1973, Eltit found no alternative but to join resistance groups and actively protest the government until democracy was restored in 1989. In the intervening years she learned the dual importance of concealment and discovery in language and the vital connections among story, politics, and personal survival.</p><p>Dick Gerdes, a professor of Spanish at the University of New Mexico, is a Fulbright fellow and an associate editor of Hispania.

It was bitterly cold, so cold that every bruise on her body seemed to throb with eager vengeance. But it was precisely that throbbing pain which forced her to put one foot in front of the other, to keep moving down the walkway, calmly, despite an inner voice warning her to turn back.<br><br>Turn 'round, turn 'round, turn 'round! It's not too late! He'll not know you attempted to escape if you turn 'round now! "Ooh, milady! That'd be his lordship Allenwhite just ahead! What are we to do?" Stella whispered frantically.<br><br>Sophie lifted her gaze, saw the portly gentleman walking briskly toward them. Instinctively, she lifted her chin, wincing at the pain in her jaw where she had been struck just that morning. "We shall say good day and keep walking," she said low, ignoring her maid's fearful grip of her fingers.<br><br>"Lady Stanwood, how do you do?" the man asked, pausing to tip his hat.<br><br>"I am very well my lord, thank you." Stella's grip tightened painfully. "You'll forgive my manners for hurrying past, sir, but I am quite overdue for an appointment with my modiste, and I confess, I'm rather chilled to the bone."<br><br>Allenwhite seemed almost relieved, gave her a curt nod. "Yes, indeed, a nasty day to be abroad. I'll not keep you, my lady." "Good day, my lord." She continued walking, pulling Stella along, her step quickening in time to her pounding heart. She would not allow herself to look back, would allow herself nothing but to stare straight ahead. They were almost there. It was too fantastic to believe, but they were almost there. Almost free.<br><br>They rounded the corner onto Bond Street, felt a respite from the wind. Where was Claudia? Sophie's heart plummeted into the pool of her fear-Claudia was not there. She had promised to meet them at the corner of Audley and Bond streets! Had something happened to her? Julian! Julian had discovered their plan and stopped Claudia from coming! The panic spread thick in Sophie's throat. No. No! She could not come so close and be denied! It was so unfair! God!<br><br>Frantic, she glanced furtively over her shoulder-Lord Allenwhite had continued on, his head down, oblivious to her and Stella. How long would it be before someone asked him if he had seen her? Sophie fumbled anxiously with her cloak, pushing it open so she could stare at the small watch pinned to her breast. Five minutes past two o'clock. Claudia was five minutes late.<br><br>She was not coming.<br><br>"By the saints, what could have become of Lady Kettering? Ooh, there's something amiss, I feel it in me bones!" Stella squeaked, gripping Sophie's arm tighter still. Unable to assure Stella they would indeed succeed, Sophie swallowed and stared at the deserted corner of Audley and Bond Street. The words simply would not come, smothered by the weight of her heart, now lodged in her throat along with the fear and the biting dis- appointment . . . and an insane sense of relief.<br><br>It is over.<br><br>Her little fantasy of escape was over. It was foolish to have thought she might have succeeded. There was nothing left but to turn around now, hurry home before William discovered what she had almost . . . No! She would not allow herself to think what he might do. She would simply hurry home now, before she was forced to imagine it.<br><br>She would find another way out of this nightmare, surely.<br><br>Or perhaps she would live with the consequence of her foolishness all the rest of her days.<br><br>Tears suddenly blinded her, and Sophie looked again at her watch. Seven minutes past. Claudia was not coming. She should have known it was impossible. She should have realized there would be no escape from the private hell she had created for herself. Sophie blinked, felt the tears freeze on her lashes. Huddled beside her, Stella was frightened unto death. Sophie opened her mouth to tell her they would go back now, end this silly escapade, but a hack careened around the corner of Bond Street onto Audley before she could speak. Her heart swelled; Stella turned, too, just as Claudia flung open the door ahead of the coachman and leapt to the ground. She glanced quickly up the street and then down, her gaze landing on Sophie and Stella several yards away. She began walking purposefully toward them.<br><br>Sophie's heart filled to almost bursting.<br><br>Freedom!<br><br>For the first time in several months, she could taste the sweetness of freedom mix with the acidity of fear.</p><h2>Superman and Batman Vs.

Women's Studies. Hybrid Genre. Biography. Memoir. Winner of the Silver Medal for Best European (Focused) Nonfiction at the 2017 Independent Publisher Book Awards. Artistic, rebellious, and unapologetically intelligent, Bo&#x17e;ena N&#x11b;mcov� defied every convention for a woman in mid-nineteenth-century Bohemia: she was active in nationalist politics, she smoked cigars, she took a series of lovers, and she laid bare her ideas and emotions in her letters and stories. THE BITTER LIFE OF BO&#x17d;ENA N&#x11a;MCOV� is a biographical collage of found texts, footnotes, fragments, and images by and about the Czech fairy tale writer, whom Milan Kundera calls the "Mother of Czech Prose." Kelcey Parker Ervick's innovative collage form, with its many voices and viewpoints, questions the concept of biographical "truth" while also revealing a nuanced and spellbinding portrait of N&#x11b;mcov�. Inspired by N&#x11b;mcov�'s letters, the book's second section, "Postcards to Bo&#x17e;ena" is Parker Ervick's epistolary memoir of her own failing marriage and her quest for a Czech typewriter, as well as a meditation on reading, writing, and happy endings. The two sections combine to create a book as defiant, enchanting, and complex as its namesake. <br> <br> "Kelcey Parker Ervick's THE BITTER LIFE OF BO&#x17d;ENA N&#x11a;MCOV� is a singular compendium&#x2014;a handbook, a digest, an offering, a constellation in orbit around the strange bright star of nineteenth-century Czech writer N&#x11b;mcov�. Via a series of carefully curated letters, excerpts, images, and documents, N&#x11b;mcov� is brought to life in curious gasps. But the book is also a vivid and gripping portrait of another artist, Kelcey Parker Ervick, who, in searching for the other finds something of herself."&#x2014;Danielle Dutton, author of <em>Margaret the First</em> <br> <br> "THE BITTER LIFE OF BO&#x17d;ENA N&#x11a;MCOV� by Kelcey Parker Ervick is one of the least bitter, most loving books I have read in a long time, and it's beautifully made.

Reprint.</p><p><p><b>David Brazier</b> is the author of <i>The New Buddhism</i> and <i>Zen Therapy</i>. A registered psychotherapist who lives in London, Brazier is spiritual teacher to the Order of Amida Buddha, a religious community dedicated to socially engaged Buddhism.</p>Buddhism does not offer an escape from suffering, writes Zen Buddhist psychotherapist Brazier, but rather teaches us how to live "meaningfully in an afflicted world." Believing that this is but one of many widespread misconceptions regarding core Buddhist teachings, Brazier offers a new and clarifying approach to the Four Noble Truths in this commonsensical and quietly radical treatise. He begins with a fresh definition of the phrase "noble truth" itself. The "truth," he asserts, is not that life is suffering but that "suffering will always be a part of our lives." Pain and pleasure, life and death are inextricably connected, and it is this paradoxical dynamic that makes life rich and compelling. Nobility implies courage and states of mind and actions worthy of respect. What the Buddha understood, Brazier explains, is that "pride and dignity play a central role in human psychology." This helpful elucidation leads to a discussion of the Middle Path, or the Eightfold Way, that will guide Westerners to a genuine understanding of Buddhist precepts and to applying them to everyday life. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>Machines Like Me</h2><p><b>**THE NUMBER ONE BESTSELLER**</b><br><b></b><br><b>Britain has lost the Falklands war, Margaret Thatcher battles Tony Benn for power and Alan Turing achieves a breakthrough in artificial intelligence.

Scythia, my jaws wide open to the gale, hoping that the salt spray would wash the bad taste out of my mouth: the taste that was my life so far.<br> Somewhere, a thousand miles behind us over the eastern horizon, lay the village of Bishop&#x2019;s Lacey and Buckshaw, my former home, where my father, Colonel Haviland de Luce, and my sisters, Ophelia and Daphne, were most likely, at this very moment, getting on nicely with their lives as if I had never existed.<br> They had already forgotten me. I was sure of it.<br> Only the faithful family retainers, Dogger and Mrs.&nbsp;Mullet, would have shed a furtive tear at my departure, but even so, they, too, in time, would have only foggy memories of Flavia.<br> Out here on the wild Atlantic, the Scythia&#x2019;s bow was hauling itself up&nbsp;. . . and up&nbsp;. . . and up out of the sea, climbing sickeningly toward the sky, then crashing down with a horrendous hollow booming, throwing out great white wings of water to port and starboard. It was like riding bareback on an enormous steel angel doing the breaststroke.<br> Although it was still early September, the sea was madness. We had encountered the remnants of a tropical hurricane, and now, for more than two days, had been tossed about like a cast--off cork.<br> Everyone except the captain and I&#x2014;-or so it seemed&#x2014;-had dragged themselves off to their bunks, so that the only sounds to be heard as one reeled along the pitching, rolling corridors to dinner were the groan of stressed steel and, behind closed doors on either side, the evacuation of scores of stomachs. With nearly nine hundred passengers on board, it was a sobering sound.<br> As for me, I seem to be blessed with a natural immunity to the tossing seas: the result, I supposed, of seafaring ancestors such as Thaddeus de Luce, who, although only a lad at the Battle of Trafalgar, was said to have brought lemonade to the dying Admiral Nelson, and to have held his cold and clammy hand.<br> Nelson&#x2019;s last words, actually, were not the widely reported &#x201c;Kiss me, Hardy,&#x201d; addressed to Captain Thomas Hardy of the Victory, but rather, &#x201c;Drink, drink&nbsp;. . . fan, fan&nbsp;. . . rub, rub,&#x201d; whispered feverishly to the wide--eyed young Thaddeus, who, although reduced to tears at the sight of his mortally wounded hero, was doing his best to keep the great man&#x2019;s circulation from crystallizing.<br> The wind ripped at my hair and tore at my thin autumn coat. I inhaled the salt air as deeply as I dared, the sea spray running in torrents down my face.<br> A hand seized my arm roughly.<br> &#x201c;What the devil do you think you&#x2019;re doing?&#x201d;<br> I spun round, startled, trying to wriggle free.<br> It was, of course, Ryerson Rainsmith.<br> &#x201c;What the devil do you think you&#x2019;re doing?&#x201d; he repeated. He was one of those people who thought that the secret of gaining the upper hand was to ask every question twice.<br> The best way of dealing with them is not to answer.<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been looking everywhere for you. Dorsey is beside herself with worry.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Does that mean there are now two of her to put up with?&#x201d; I wanted to ask, but I didn&#x2019;t.<br> With a name like Dorsey it was no wonder he called her &#x201c;Dodo&#x201d;&#x2014;-or at least he did whenever he thought they were alone.<br> &#x201c;We were afraid you&#x2019;d fallen overboard. Now come below at once. Go to your cabin and put on some dry clothing. You look like a drowned rat.&#x201d;<br> That did it. It was the last straw.<br> Ryerson Rainsmith, I thought, your days&#x2014;-your very hours&#x2014;-are numbered.<br> I would go to the young and handsome ship&#x2019;s doctor, whom I had met at supper the night before last. On the pretext of an upset tummy I would beg a bottle of sodium bicarbonate. A healthy dose of the stuff&#x2014;-I smiled at the word &#x201c;healthy&#x201d;&#x2014;-slipped into Rainsmith&#x2019;s invariable bottle of champagne would do the trick.<br> Taken on a full stomach&#x2014;-no worries about that where Ryerson Rainsmith was concerned!&#x2014;-sodium bicarbonate combined with effervescent alcohol could be deadly: first, the headache, which seemed to grow by the minute, followed by mental confusion and severe stomach pain; then the muscle weakness, the thin stools like coffee grounds, the tremors, the twitching: all the classic symptoms of alkalosis. I would insist on taking him out on deck for a healthy walk. Forcing him to hyperventilate in all this fresh, invigorating air would speed up the process&#x2014;-like sloshing petrol onto a fire.<br> If I could manage to raise the pH of his arterial blood to 7.65, he wouldn&#x2019;t stand the chance of a snowman in Hades. He would die in agony.<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m coming,&#x201d; I said sullenly, and followed him at the speed of a sleepy snail, aft across the rolling, pitching foredeck.<br> Hard to imagine, I thought, that I had actually been handed over to this rancid slab of humanity. Hard to forget, though, how it had come about.<br> It had all begun with that awful business about my mother, Harriet. After ten years of being missing in the mountains of Tibet, Harriet had returned to Buckshaw in circumstances so painful that my brain was still forbidding me to think about them for more than a few seconds at a time; any longer than that, and my internal censor snipped my thread of memory as easily as Atropos, that dreaded third sister of the Fates, is said to snip the thread of life with her scissors when our time has come to die.<br> The upshot of it all was that I was to be packed off to Miss Bodycote&#x2019;s Female Academy, Harriet&#x2019;s old school in Canada, where I was to be trained to assume some ancient and hereditary role of which I was still kept mostly in ignorance.<br> &#x201c;You shall simply have to learn your way into it,&#x201d; Aunt Felicity had told me. &#x201c;But in time you shall come to realize that Duty is the best and wisest of all teachers.&#x201d;<br> I wasn&#x2019;t quite sure what she meant by that, but since my aunt was rather high up in this mysterious whatever--it--was, she was not to be argued with.<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s something like &#x2018;The Firm,&#x2019; isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;The nickname that the Royal Family call themselves.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Somewhat,&#x201d; Aunt Felicity said, &#x201c;but with this difference: Royalty is permitted to abdicate. We are not.&#x201d;<br> It had been at Aunt Felicity&#x2019;s insistence that I was packed up like a bundle of old rags and tossed onto a ship to Canada.<br> There had been protests, of course, at my going alone, notably from the vicar and his wife. Then there had been some talk about having Feely and her fianc�, Dieter Schrantz, accompany me on my transatlantic journey, but that idea was scotched on the grounds not only that it would be improper, but also that Feely&#x2019;s position as organist at St.&nbsp;Tancred&#x2019;s was classified as an essential service.<br> At that point Cynthia Richardson, the vicar&#x2019;s wife, threw her own name into the hat. Although Cynthia and I had had our ups and downs, we had recently become great pals, an unexpected twist in my life I was still finding hard to believe. Away from her husband, Cynthia was brimming with fun: a girl again, in spite of herself. The vicar would have been horrified at the amount of tea the two of us sprayed out in hysterical laughter upon the slate floor of the vicarage kitchen.<br> But then, alas, Cynthia&#x2019;s name, too, was taken out of the running. Like Feely, she was too important to be released. Without her, there would be no church calendar, no church bulletins, no flowers for the altar, no home visits, no Girl Guides, no clean cassocks and surplices, no meals for the vicar&nbsp;. . . the list went on and on.<br> I knew she was disappointed: She told me so.<br> &#x201c;I should have liked to see Canada,&#x201d; she told me. &#x201c;My father, as a young man, worked as a log driver&#x2014;-a river pig&#x2014;-on the Ottawa River. Instead of fairy tales at bedtime, he used to tell me horrific stories of the loup--garou&#x2014;-the werewolf of the Canadian woods&#x2014;-and of how he once gave a good dunking to Ole Bull and Big Jacques Laroque in the log--rolling contest at the Rapides des Allumettes, both on the same morning.<br> &#x201c;I had always hoped that I would one day be able to lace on a pair of spiked logger&#x2019;s boots and have a go at it myself,&#x201d; she added wistfully. &#x201c;Now I suppose I shan&#x2019;t have a chance.&#x201d;<br> I could have wept at the sight of her sitting there at the vicarage kitchen table, her eyes staring damply into her past.<br> &#x201c;The Altar Guild is likely just as dangerous,&#x201d; I said brightly, hoping to cheer her up, but I don&#x2019;t think she heard me.<br> That same afternoon, Aunt Felicity announced that the problem was solved: She had heard from Miss Bodycote&#x2019;s Female Academy that the chairman of the academy&#x2019;s board of guardians, who had been summering in England, would be setting sail for home in September.<br> He had been shooting for a few days with one of our neighbors, Lord Crowsborough, and it would be no trouble at all, he said, to drop by and pick me up&#x2014;-as if I were an empty milk bottle.<br> I shall never forget the day that he arrived at Buckshaw&#x2014;-an hour and a half late, I might add&#x2014;-in his borrowed Bentley. He had leapt from the car and dashed round to the offside to open the door for Dorsey, the queen of Sheba, who unfolded herself from the machine like a stork from an eggshell and stood blinking in the September sunshine as if she had just been startled awake from a hypnotic trance. She was wrapped in a dress of turquoise silk, with a matching scarf on her head and far too much magenta lipstick on her mouth. Need I say more?<br> &#x201c;Oh, Ryerson,&#x201d; she cooed, gazing at our ancestral home. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all so quaint&#x2014;-so tumble--de--dump. Just as you said it would be.&#x201d;<br> Ryerson Rainsmith, in a summer suit the color of cold coffee and curdled cream, stood looking round in a self--satisfied manner with his thumbs tucked into his yellow waistcoat, drumming his fingers on his ample stomach. I was reminded of a partridge.<br> Father, who had gone to the front door to greet him, stepped out onto the gravel sweep and shook hands.<br> &#x201c;Colonel de Luce, I presume,&#x201d; Rainsmith said, as if he had just solved some great mystery. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like you to say hello to my wife, Dorsey. Come and shake hands with the squire, my dear. It&#x2019;s not every day you&#x2019;ll get such an opportunity.<br> &#x201c;Ha ha ha,&#x201d; he added mirthlessly. &#x201c;And this must be our little Flavia!&#x201d;<br> On paper, the man was already dead.<br> &#x201c;Mr.&nbsp;Rainsmith,&#x201d; he said, shoving a damp hand into my face.<br> Dogger had once warned me to be wary of any man who introduced himself as &#x201c;Mr.&#x201d; It was an honorific, he said, a mark of respect to be bestowed by others, but never, ever, under any circumstances, upon oneself.<br> I ignored the extended hand.<br> &#x201c;Howdy,&#x201d; I said.<br> Father stiffened. His eyes narrowed. I knew what was going on in his head.<br> My father was from an era when gentlemen were taught that politeness was everything, that the only sure way to lose out to the Philistines was to lose your temper and admit that they had wounded you. His years in a Japanese prisoner--of--war camp had perfected his ability to remain, in the face of insult, as silent as a standing stone.<br> &#x201c;Please come in,&#x201d; he said, gesturing to the open door. I wanted to give him a swift kick in the trousers and at the same time I wanted to hug him. Pride in a parent often takes strange forms.<br> &#x201c;What a quaint old hall!&#x201d; Dorsey Rainsmith said. Her voice was as sharp as elderly cheese and her words echoed back unpleasantly from the dark paneling of the foyer. &#x201c;We have the same trouble with cracking varnish in our salon back home in Toronto, don&#x2019;t we, Ryerson? Smithers, our handy-man, says it&#x2019;s from either excessive heat or excessive cold.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Or age,&#x201d; I suggested.<br> Father pierced me with a transparent look, but I knew what he meant.<br> In the drawing room, without being asked, the Rainsmiths subsided into the coziest seats, while Father and I perched on the edge of the remaining chairs.<br> After an interval timed to perfection, Dogger appeared and offered tea. I could see that the Rainsmiths were impressed.<br> &#x201c;Thank you, Dogger,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;And please convey our thanks to Mrs.&nbsp;Mullet.&#x201d;<br> It was a game Dogger and I played: a game with rules so subtle that no one outside our immediate family could ever hope to grasp them.<br> &#x201c;Not at all, Miss Flavia,&#x201d; Dogger said. &#x201c;It is our very great pleasure to be of service.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Yes, thank you, Dogger,&#x201d; Ryerson Rainsmith said, out of his depth but paddling madly to keep his head above water.<br> &#x201c;And also your Mrs.&nbsp;Mullet,&#x201d; his wife added.<br> Dogger gave them a three--percent smile and vanished in the way he does.<br> After a while, Daffy and Feely came into the room, pretended to be bereft at the thought of losing me, chatted in a maddeningly polite fashion with the Rainsmiths, then drifted off to their respective books and looking glass.<br> But there&#x2019;s no sense in raking through the ashes of that dismal afternoon.<br> It was decreed that the Rainsmiths would be my chaperones on the voyage to Canada, where they would deliver me up safely to the doorstep of Miss Bodycote&#x2019;s Female Academy.<br> &#x201c;Chaperones?&#x201d; Daffy said when they were gone. &#x201c; &#x2018;Cicerones,&#x2019; you mean. That&#x2019;s the proper word for it. Flavia on the Grand Tour&#x2014;-just think! I hope you appreciate it, you lucky chump. I&#x2019;d give anything to be in your plimsolls.&#x201d;<br> I threw a handy tennis racket at her, but I missed.<br> ***<br> I missed Daffy in a very different way as I trudged up the sloping deck in the footsteps of Ryerson Rainsmith. Daffy, at least, was my own flesh and blood and could be defied without permanent damage. Ryerson Rainsmith, by contrast, would remember this moment for as long as he lived. He would still be telling his putrid grandchildren about it when he was no more than a shriveled pudding in a wheelchair.<br> &#x201c;And there she was&#x2014;-there I found her,&#x201d; he would tell them in a cracked, quavering voice, &#x201c;standing on the first six inches of the ship&#x2019;s bow with the waves breaking over her head.&#x201d;<br> He spoke not a word until we were belowdecks, tottering like walking toys along the heaving passageway toward the Rainsmiths&#x2019; stateroom. He had obviously forgotten ordering me to change into dry clothing. Or perhaps he had decided to deliver me up damp to his wife.<br> &#x201c;Take my advice,&#x201d; he said in a conspiratorial whisper, as if we were suddenly old pals. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t rile her.&#x201d;<br> He rapped at the door with his knuckles before opening it and motioning me to go ahead of him.<br> By the way Dorsey Rainsmith looked at me, I might have been a cobra shoved into her face.<br> &#x201c;Look at you!&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Just look at you!&#x201d;<br> It is an order often given to girls of my age with little thought given to how difficult it is to carry out, actually.<br> I crossed my eyes very slightly, but if she noticed, it went over her head.<br> &#x201c;Where have you been?&#x201d; she demanded.<br> &#x201c;On deck,&#x201d; I said.<br> &#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Fresh air.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You might have fallen overboard. Did you never think of that?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;No,&#x201d; I said truthfully. I might also have been hit on the noggin and killed by a falling...</p><h2>NAME - DROPPING: The Life and Lies of Alan King</h2><p>The comedian recounts some of the high points of his life and career and tells stories about famous and not-so-famous friends, including Frank Sinatra, Charlie Chaplin, Judy Garland, Billy Crystal, and the Kennedys</p><p><b>Alan King</b> conceived and developed this book in the period of time before he died, in May 2004. It would be his final accomplishment in a lifetime of prolific achievement.Comedian-actor-producer King tries his hand as philosopher- king with the guidance of Amanuensis to the Stars Chase (Josephine: The Hungry Heart, with Jean-Claude Baker, 1994, etc.). They produce the prototypical showbiz autobiography: not a lot of depth, but high and wide with firsthand theatrical anecdotes. As advertised, the names do, indeed, drop. In a storm, a blizzard, a hurricane, a tornado the names appear. Famed political and sports figures take their bows, but mainly, perforce, the leading characters in King's yarns are comrades in grease paint. The original angry young comedian, now in his seventh decade, appears to have introduced Martin to Lewis, pushed Lena Horne to her comeback, bucked up Garland when she needed it, become Sinatra's pal and worked Siegel and the Mob in the early days of Vegas. From his days of boxing and drinking and tummeling in the Catskills at age 15, he fought his way up to perform for the queen and, even better, to join to pantheon of Friar zanies and Hillcrest Club funny men. He became an actor (specializing, it turned out, in mobsters and rabbis) and a producer. He had the juice, he reports. Throughout, he remained married to his childhood sweetheart, Jeanette. It must not have been easy for her. (Jeanette has the last word, and it's the most revealing chapter of the book). If the names of Georgie Jessel, Don Marques, James Barton, Leon and Eddie, or the Ritz Brothers mean anything at all to the reader, King's (Is Salami and Eggs Better Than Sex?, 1985) monologue in one is a turn that will have special resonance. Comedians no longer brandish cigars. An epoch is ending, and Alan King, playing the part of The Old Vaudevillian for all it's worth, offers his valedictory.

From his first day in the White House until long after his appearance as the only presidential aide ever to testify in an impeachment trial, Blumenthal acted in or witnessed nearly all the battles of the Clinton years. His major new book&#x2014;part history, part memoir&#x2014;is the first inside account we have of the presidency of William Jefferson Clinton.<br><br><i>The Clinton Wars</i> begins in 1987, when Blumenthal first met Bill and Hillary Clinton. His chronicle of Clinton&#x2019;s first presidential campaign and first term draws on his experiences as confidant to both the President and the First Lady, and is enriched with previously unpublished revelations about both. This remarkable personal interpretation goes far in explaining the polarizing nature of Clinton&#x2019;s presence on the national scene. <br><br>The narrative of Clinton&#x2019;s second term is even more dramatic. Blumenthal takes special note of the battle that was waged within the media between the President&#x2019;s detractors and defenders, which he expands into a vivid picture of Washington society torn apart by warring factions. But he does not neglect the wars fought on other fronts&#x2014;in Kosovo, against Congress, and for economic prosperity. His remarkable book ends with the inside story of the fight to elect Al Gore in 2000 and extend the legacy of the Clinton-Gore Administration.<br> <br>Every page of this unrivaled, authoritative book, with its intimate insights into Clinton&#x2019;s personality and politics, attests to Blumenthal&#x2019;s literary skill, profound understanding of politics, and unique perspective on crucial events of our recent past. <i>The Clinton Wars</i> is a lasting contribution to American history.<br></p><p>The title of journalist turned-embattled-White House aide Sidney Blumenthal's memoir/history of his tumultuous years inside the Clinton presidency is both literal and figurative, if something of an understatement; "apocalypse" would seem more to the point. Erudite and fiercely unapologetic, Blumenthal belatedly provides the overwrought saga's protagonists what they so often publicly lacked in its historical context: passionate advocacy and precious perspective. No mere presidential history, the battles chronicled here transcend politics as usual, bitter partisan campaigns whose roots Blumenthal forcefully argues extend beneath lingering class and generational resentments into the darkest heart of America's Southern racist past. Hillary Clinton's accusations of a "vast right-wing conspiracy" garnered cynical chuckles in its heyday; Blumenthal (whose own teasing White House nickname was "Grassy Knoll") merely cuts its treachery down to size, documenting the usual suspects, dates, and places with amply footnoted vengeance. There's irony to burn, from unexpected early Clinton supporters (former GOP standard bearer Barry Goldwater) and the blatant moral hypocrisy of his Congressional accusers to the Supreme Court's sole dissenting voice in arguments to reinstate the Special Prosecutor statute, Justice Scalia (who presciently warned it could easily become the tool of political witch hunts), and the heretical notion that the Clintons may have been the <i>least</i> cynical players in the entire drama; they certainly seem it's most tragically human. It's hardly surprising that much of the Washington news establishment has attacked Blumenthal's tome with equal ferocity; in Blumenthal's telling, the D.C. press corps that zealously safeguarded democracy during Watergate had by the advent of Clinton devolved into an insular <i>faux</i> aristocracy resentful of perceived carpetbaggers (especially from Arkansas) and suckers for any politically-motivated leak, rumor, or innuendo that might give them a leg up on the competition. The media's inept handling of the story is even more ironic considering much of what Blumenthal does here derives from the simple advice Watergate informer "Deep Throat" gave reporters during that crisis: "Follow the money." <i>--Jerry McCulley</i>"Not only is [Blumenthal&#x2019;s] book a roaring good read, it is extremely educational and should have a lasting effect on people&#x2019;s understanding of many of the events of the 1990s." &#x2014;William Jefferson Clinton <p>"Agree with him or not, I don&#x2019;t see how anyone can expect to understand the political history of the past decade without reading [Blumenthal&#x2019;s] new book." &#x2014;Eric Alterman, author of What Liberal Media?</p></p><h2>Oswald: Return of the King (The Northumbrian Thrones)</h2><p>The exiled family of King �thelfrith of Northumbria arrive, after much hardship, on the island of Iona, where the monastery founded by St Columba has become a centre of worship and learning. Young Oswald becomes firm friends with a novice, Aidan. When Aidan professes his final vows, Oswald and his little brother Oswy are received into the church. As befits a young prince, Oswald learns to fight. However, Aidan&#39;s example attacts him and he is on the point of deciding to become a monk when news reaches Iona that his half brother, Eanfrith, has been killed by Cadwallon, the king who defeated Edwin. Oswald sails back to Northumbria and meets Cadwallon in battle, defeating and killing him. Oswald, now undisputed king of Northumbria, gives Aidan the island of Lindisfarne as his base.

For the first time the <i>Summa</i>, which synthesizes with immense scholarship and brilliance Aristotelian learning on the nature of the world and the human person with biblical teaching on God's loving purpose in creating them, is available in a concisely distilled translation and in a form that will appeal both to professional students and to interested general readers.</p><p>Aquinas, while studying at the University of Naples, joined the Dominican monastic order in 1244. Under St. Albert the Great he embarked on a life of teaching, preaching, and writing. He was formally canonized in 1323.The real meat of St. Thomas has been captured here with remarkable good judgement, and it is in fact a fresh stimulation experience to read Aquinas&#39; doctrine on a given point gathered all together. --W.

It's a mechanism whereby God accomplishes great things in us." Do you ever sense that there's far more to prayer, and to God's vision for your life, than what you're experiencing? It's time you learned from the legend of Honi the Circle Maker -- a man bold enough to draw a circle in the sand and not budge from inside it until God answered his prayers for his people. What impossibly big dream is God calling you to draw a prayer circle around? Sharing inspiring stories from his own experiences as a circle maker, Mark Batterson will help you uncover your heart's deepest desires and God-given dreams and unleash them through the kind of audacious prayer that God delights to answer.</p><p>Mark Batterson serves as the lead pastor of National Community Church in Washington, D.

Or so his employers believe - until he mysteriously returns and attempts to assassinate his boss, M - because he&#39;s been brainwashed by the KGB! With his conditioning removed, M wastes no time in dispatching Bond on a deadly mission to track down hired killer Francisco Scaramanga.</p><p>Ian Fleming is the world-famous novelist and creator of James Bond. James Lawrence began his writing career scripting training films for the US Armed Forces, and moved on to write features including Buck Rogers and Joe Palooka. Yaroslav Horak created the outback adventure strip Mike Steel for the Sydney Morning Herald, and illustrated all the Bond feature adventures bar Casino Royale.<p><b>1. 'CAN I HELP YOU?'</b></p> <p>The Secret Service holds much that is kept secret even from very senior officers in the organisation. Only M and his Chief of Staff know absolutely everything there is to know. The latter is responsible for keeping the Top Secret record known as 'The War Book' so that, in the event of the death of both of them, the whole story, apart from what is available to individual Sections and Stations, would be available to their successors.</p> <p>One thing that James Bond, for instance, didn't know was the machinery at Headquarters for dealing with the public, whether friendly or otherwise - drunks, lunatics, bona fide applications to join the Service, and enemy agents with plans for penetration or even assassination.</p> <p>On that cold, clear morning in November he was to see the careful cog-wheels in motion.</p> <p>The girl at the switchboard at the Ministry of Defence flicked the switch to 'Hold' and said to her neighbour, 'It's another nut who says he's James Bond. Even knows his code number. Says he wants to speak to M personally.'</p> <p>The senior girl shrugged. The switchboard had had quite a few such calls since, a year before, James Bond's death on a mission to Japan had been announced in the Press. There had even been one pestiferous woman who, at every full moon, passed on messages from Bond from Uranus where it seemed he had got stuck while awaiting entry into heaven. She said, 'Put him through to Liaison, Pat.'</p> <p>The Liaison Section was the first cog in the machine, the first sieve. The operator got back on the line: 'Just a moment, sir. I'll put you on to an officer who may be able to help you.'</p> <p>James Bond, sitting on the edge of his bed, said, 'Thank you.'</p> <p>He had expected some delay before he could establish his identity. He had been warned to expect it by the charming 'Colonel Boris' who had been in charge of him for the past few months after he had finished his treatment in the luxurious Institute on the Nevsky Prospekt in Leningrad. A man's voice came on the line. 'Captain Walker speaking. Can I help you?'</p> <p>James Bond spoke slowly and clearly. 'This is Commander James Bond speaking. Number 007. Would you put me through to M, or his secretary, Miss Moneypenny. I want to make an appointment.'</p> <p>Captain Walker pressed two buttons on the side of his telephone. One of them switched on a tape recorder for the use of his department, the other alerted one of the duty officers in the Action Room of the Special Branch at Scotland Yard that he should listen to the conversation, trace the call, and at once put a tail on the caller. It was now up to Captain Walker, who was in fact an extremely bright ex-prisoner-of-war interrogator from Military Intelligence, to keep the subject talking for as near five minutes as possible. He said, 'I'm afraid I don't know either of these two people. Are you sure you've got the right number?'</p> <p>James Bond patiently repeated the Regent number which was the main outside line for the Secret Service. Together with so much else, he had forgotten it, but Colonel Boris had known it and had made him write it down among the small print on the front page of his forged British passport that said his name was Frank Westmacott, company director.</p> <p>'Yes,' said Captain Walker sympathetically. 'We seem to have got that part of it right. But I'm afraid I can't place these people you want to talk to. Who exactly are they? This Mr Em, for instance. I don't think we've got anyone of that name at the Ministry.'</p> <p>'Do you want me to spell it out? You realise this is an open line?'</p> <p>Captain Walker was rather impressed by the confidence in the speaker's voice. He pressed another button and, so that Bond would hear it, a telephone bell rang. He said, 'Hang on a moment, would you? There's someone on my other line.' Captain Walker got on to the head of his Section. ' Sorry, sir. I've got a chap on who says he's James Bond and wants to talk to M. I know it sounds crazy and I've gone through the usual motions with the Special Branch and so on, but would you mind listening for a minute? Thank you, sir.'</p> <p>Two rooms away a harassed man, who was the Chief Security Officer for the Secret Service, said 'Blast!' and pressed a switch. A microphone on his desk came to life. The Chief Security Officer sat very still. He badly needed a cigarette, but his room was now 'live' to Captain Walker and to the lunatic who called himself 'James Bond'. Captain Walker's voice came over at full strength. 'I'm sorry. Now then. This man Mr Em you want to talk to. I'm sure we needn't worry about security. Could you be more specific?'</p> <p>James Bond frowned. He didn't know that he had frowned and he wouldn't have been able to explain why he had done so. He said, and lowered his voice, again inexplicably, 'Admiral Sir Miles Messervy. He is head of a department in your Ministry. The number of his room used to be twelve on the eighth floor. He used to have a secretary called Miss Moneypenny. Good-looking girl. Brunette. Shall I give you the Chief of Staff's name? No? Well let's see, it's Wednesday. Shall I tell you what'll be the main dish on the menu in the canteen? It should be steak-and-kidney pudding.'</p> <p>The Chief Security Officer picked up the direct telephone to Captain Walker. Captain Walker said to James Bond,' Damn! There's the other telephone again. Shan't be a minute.' He picked up the green telephone. 'Yes, sir?' '</p> <p>I don't like that bit about the steak-and-kidney pudding. Pass him on to the Hard Man. No. Cancel that. Make it the Soft. There was always something odd about 007's death. No body. No solid evidence. And the people on that Japanese island always seemed to me to be playing it pretty close to the chest. The Stone Face act. It's just possible. Keep me informed, would you?'</p> <p>Captain Walker got back to James Bond. 'Sorry about that. It's being a busy day. Now then, this inquiry of yours. Afraid I can't help you myself. Not my part of the Ministry. The man you want is Major Townsend. He should be able to locate this man you want to see. Got a pencil? It's No. 44 Kensington Cloisters. Got that? Kensington double five double five. Give me ten minutes and I'll have a word with him and see if he can help. All right?'</p> <p>James Bond said dully, 'That's very kind of you.' He put down the telephone. He waited exactly ten minutes and picked up the receiver and asked for the number.</p> <p>James Bond was staying at the Ritz Hotel. Colonel Boris had told him to do so. Bond's file in the KGB Archive described him as a high-liver, so, on arrival in London, he must stick to the KGB image of the high life. Bond went down in the lift to the Arlington Street entrance. A man at the news stand got a good profile of him with a buttonhole Minox. When Bond went down the shallow steps to the street and asked the commissionaire for a taxi, a canonflex with a telescopic lens clicked away busily from a Red Roses laundry van at the neighbouring goods entrance and, in due course, the same van followed Bond's taxi while a man inside the van reported briefly to the Action Room of the Special Branch.</p> <p>No. 44 Kensington Cloisters was a dull Victorian mansion in grimy red brick. It had been chosen for its purpose because it had once been the headquarters of the Empire League for Noise Abatement, and its entrance still bore the brass plate of this long-defunct organisation, the empty shell of which had been purchased by the Secret Service through the Commonwealth Relations Office. It also had a spacious old-fashioned basement, re-equipped as detention cells, and a rear exit into a quiet mews. The Red Roses laundry van watched the front door shut behind James Bond and then moved off at a sedate speed to its garage not far from Scotland Yard while the process of developing the canonflex film went on in its interior.</p> <p>'Appointment with Major Townsend,' said Bond.</p> <p>'Yes. He's expecting you, sir. Shall I take your raincoat?' The powerful-looking doorman put the coat on a coathanger and hung it up on one of a row of hooks beside the door. As soon as Bond was safely doseted with Major Townsend, the coat would go swiftly to the laboratory on the first floor where its provenance would be established from an examination of the fabric. Pocket dust would be removed for more leisurely research. 'Would you follow me, sir?'</p> <p>It was a narrow corridor of freshly painted clapboard with a tall, single window which concealed the Fluoroscope triggered automatically from beneath the ugly patterned carpet. The findings of its X-ray eye would be fed into the laboratory above the passage. The passage ended in two facing doors marked 'A' and 'B'. The doorman knocked on Room B and stood aside for Bond to enter.</p> <p>It was a pleasant, very light room, dose-carpeted in dove-grey Wilton. The military prints on the cream walls were expensively framed. A small, bright fire burned under an Adam mantelpiece which bore a number of silver trophies and two photographs in leather frames - one of a nice-looking woman and the other of three nice-looking children. There was a central table with a bowl of flowers and two comfort-able club chain on either side of the fire. No desk or filing cabinets, nothing official-looking. A tall man, as pleasant as the room, got up from the far chair, dropped The Times on the carpet beside it, and came forward with a welcoming smile. He held out a firm, dry hand.</p> <p>This was the Soft Man.</p> <p>'Come in. Come in. Take a pew. Cigarette? Not the ones I seem to remember you favour. Just the good old Senior Service.'</p> <p>Major Townsend had carefully prepared the loaded remark - a reference to Bond's liking for the Morland Specials with the three gold rings. He noted Bond's apparent lack of comprehension. Bond took a cigarette and accepted a light. They sat down facing one another. Major Townsend crossed his legs comfortably. Bond sat up straight Major Townsend said, 'Well now. How can I help you?'</p> <p>Across the corridor, in Room A, a cold Office-of-Works cube with no furnitu...</p></p><h2>By England&#39;s Aid : Or, the Freeing of the Netherlands (Works of G. A.

In England, Benjamin Disraeli observed that the world was witnessing "a greater political event than the French revolution of last century. . . . [T]here is not a diplomatic tradition which has not been swept away. . . . The balance of power has been entirely destroyed." Disraeli's powers of prophecy, in this as in much else, were formidable.<br><br>The Age of Bismarck saw Germany become the dynamo of Europe--its preeminent economic and military power, its scientific and educational nerve center, and a place of tremendous artistic ferment. But there would be no simple spell to return to their bottles the genies unleashed by these vast forces, and Michael St�rmer traces the convergence of people and events that sent Europe's fragile balance of power over the brink&nbsp;&nbsp;and into conflict. No war was fought for less purpose or with greater slaughter than the First World War which, in Michael St�rmer's assured hands, arrives as the next-to-last act of an epic drama all the more tragic for the blazing brilliance of its opening scenes. Though the drama's final horrible act, the Second World War, takes place offstage from The German Empire, it is impossible to understand its origins without the history Michael St�rmer tells here with such elegance and insight.</p><p>&#x201c;A concise, richly descriptive, and authoritative history.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>&#x201c;A brief yet thorough introduction to an episode of German history that has proven pivotal . . . over the past century and a half. . . .

This translation by Samuel Butler, accompanied by illustrations by John Flaxman, is the perfect edition for a first reading of the Odyssey. Memoria Press also publishes a study guide and teacher&#39;s guide to help the work come alive for the student.</p><p>&#x201c;Hateful to me as the gates of Hades is that man who hides one thing in his heart and speaks another.&#x201d; &#x2014;Homer The Greek poet Homer was born sometime between the 12th and 8th centuries BC, possibly somewhere on the coast of Asia Minor. He is famous for the epic poems The Iliad and The Odyssey, which have had an enormous effect on Western culture, but very little is known about their alleged author. Homer is a mystery. The Greek epic poet credited with the enduring epic tales of The Iliad and The Odyssey is an enigma insofar as actual facts of his life go. Some scholars believe him to be one man; others think these iconic stories were created by a group. A variation on the group idea stems from the fact that storytelling was an oral tradition and Homer compiled the stories, then recited them to memory.</p><h2>Come All You Brave Soldiers: Blacks In The Revolutionary War</h2><p>From the Boston Massacre and the battles at Lexington and Concord to the final British surrender at Yorktown, a compelling and informative study chronicles the contributions of African-American soldiers to the colonial struggle for freedom during the Revolutionary War.</p><p>Grade 6-10?An interesting and informative survey of African-American participation in the American Revolution. Cox begins his narrative with the Boston Massacre and follows the course of the war through the Battle of Yorktown. While clearly describing the inequities faced by black soldiers, the author also points out that Native Americans, women, and indentured servants were not part of the "all men" who were "created equal." Southern unwillingness to enlist black soldiers for fear of encouraging slave revolts is chronicled. Jefferson and Washington both come in for their share of just criticism, while other leaders who championed the cause of freedom for all are cited for their words and actions. Although Cox incorporates information on individuals, his emphasis is historical rather than biographical. Thomas Fleming's Give Me Liberty (Scholastic, 1971; o.p.) covers some of the same material, but with less detail, fewer names and relevant illustrations, and a generous spattering of fictionalized dialogue. Eugene Winslow's Afro-Americans '76: Black Americans in the Founding of Our Nation (Afro-Am Publishing, 1975) discusses pre-Revolutionary America and the first half of the 19th century and presents a series of brief biographical vignettes linked by short historical overviews. Come All You Brave Soldiers is preferable to either. Black-and-white reproductions of period prints, documents, and paintings are included in two insert sections rather than near their subject matter, but this is a minor flaw in an otherwise superior treatment of an important subject.?Elaine Fort Weischedel, Turner Free Library, Randolph, MA<br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.In a solid, factual chronicle, Cox (Mark Twain, 1995, etc.) retells the story of the American Revolution; he doesn't change or challenge what occurred but includes many of the details most history books have left out. Over 5,000 black men contributed to the country's cause for independence, despite the slavery and racism the land offered them. The broad scope of the work allows for only brief portraits of the brave men who are highlighted, from Crispus Attucks, who was first to die at the Boston Massacre, to Prince Whipple, who accompanied Washington as he crossed the Delaware, to Pompey Lamb, who was instrumental in Mad Anthony Wayne's capture of Stony Point. Cox astutely introduces the hypocrisy of a nation who fights for freedom while enslaving others; he also accurately presents the racial attitudes of the time through documents, letters, and speeches. In addition to paying tribute to some overlooked figures, this book also demonstrates why one historical account is never enough to establish the facts, and the surprises to be found in good research.

He is on the Triton/Evinrude E-Tec, Thomas &amp; Thomas fly rods, Quantum, and Lunker City Lures pro staffs and is the author of the best-selling book, Fishing Soft Plastics. He lives in Coventry, Rhode Island.Reading Jim White's manuscript for <i>Monster Shallow-Water Stripers</i> was enjoyable and educational. White has an unconventional way of fishing, pulling trophy fish from places other anglers pass by. His descriptions of unusual rigs were fascinating....<p><br>The photos and illustrations, and the single-sentence tips sprinkled through the book, add new dimensions to the already terrific book. The illustrations are especially helpful in the chapters on rigging soft-plastic lures and live baits. </p><p><br><br>White's rigs for snagging menhaden and catching squid will produce twice the catch in half the time. Neither of the rigs is new--hot shots have been using them for a long time but White s book is the first to illustrate them....</p><p><br>Because his previous book focused on soft-plastic baits, many fishermen assume that they are White's favorite lures. Perhaps, but the man fishes whatever, wherever and whenever it takes to catch stripers, including flies. His chapter on fly fishing is excellent. </p><p><br><br>A lot of Rhode Islanders regard White as a Bay boat fisherman, but he has also earned his chops as a surf caster and a flats wader, and the book has pictures to prove it along with solid advice on how to fish the suds and the flats. <br><br>As Lefty Kreh says in a cover blurb, "Capt.

His past body of work includes <i>Batman, Superman/Batman, Detective Comics, Batgirl, American Vampire, Justice League Beyond,</i> and many, many more.Dini and Nguyen's Batman stories from <i>Detective Comics</i> collected here are largely brief, self-contained mysteries, focusing on the colorful, bizarre characters of Batman's world. They're something of a throwback in tone to the superhero comics of the '60s and '70s: in one episode, the wicked Tweedledee and Tweedledum steal the Mad Hatter's mind-control technology to assemble the Wonderland Gang, which Batman busts up by the end of the issue. It's breezy stuff as contemporary Batman comics go, even making room for a little romance (a subplot concerns the Dark Knight's flirtations with the magician Zatanna and the sultry burglar Catwoman). Still, Dini gets a lot of juice out of the way his characters interact and comes up with clever ways to whisk each story toward its conclusion&#x2014;The Riddle Unanswered, for instance, pivots around Batman hanging out in an online chat room of amateur detectives (and a few superheroes) to trade ideas about a case. Nguyen and Fridolfs's artwork complements these stories' mood with a loose, flowing style, built around jagged chunks of black, which owes something to contemporary animation. <i>(Dec.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Pittu differentiates the Cahills&#39; adversaries with a multitude of accents and attitudes and creates extra tension by giving each a strong sense of menace and deceptiveness.

When his father, a travelling salesman, moved with his family to St Louis some years later, both he and his sister found it impossible to settle down to city life. He entered college during the Depression and left after a couple of years to take a clerical job in a shoe company. He stayed there for two years, spending the evenings writing. He entered the University of Iowa in 1938 and completed his course, at the same time holding a large number of part-time jobs of great diversity. He received a Rockefeller Fellowship in 1940 for his play Battle of Angels, and he won the Pulitzer Prize in 1948 and 1955. Among his many other plays Penguin have published A Streetcar Named Desire (1947), Summer and Smoke (1948), The Rose Tattoo (1951), Camino Real(1953), Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1955), Orpheus Descending (1957), Sweet Bird of Youth (1959), Period of Adjustment (1960), The Night of the Iguana (1961), The Milk Train Doesn&#39;t Stop Here Anymore (1963; revised 1964) and Small Craft Warnings (1972).Despite being digitally remastered, this 1964 full-cast production featuring four of America's best stage actors doesn't quite work. They sound as if they're reading lines, rather than acting--they don't manage to make the listener suspend reality and enter the life of the play. Their Southern accents seem forced and the language stilted. In addition, as the actors wander in and out of range of the microphones, their voices strengthen, then fade. The third CD of the package contains rare recordings of Williams himself reading the opening dialogue and closing scene of the play, as well as several poems. It's interesting listening to his slightly nasal, gentle drawl, yet all in all, some archival material is best left on the shelf.

According to many clinical psychologists, when the mind is forced to endure a horrifying experience, it has the ability to bury the entire memory of it so deeply within the unconscious that it can only be recalled in the form of a flashback triggered by a sight, a smell, or a sound. Therapists and lawyers have created an industry based on treating and litigating the cases of people who suddenly claim to have "recovered" memories of everything from child abuse to murder.<br>Dr. Loftus reveals that despite decades of research, there is absolutely no controlled scientific support for the idea that memories of trauma are routinely banished into the unconscious and then reliably recovered years later.</p><p><b>Dr. Elizabeth Loftus,</b> a professor of psychology at the University of Washington, is also the author of <i>Witness for the Defense</i> and <i>Eyewitness Testimony</i>.<br><br><b>Katherine Ketcham</b> is also the co-author of <i>Under the Influence</i>, <i>The Spirituality of Imperfection</i>, <i>Beyond the Influence</i>, <i>The Power of Empathy</i>, and other books.<br>"Astute, scientifically informed, and compassionate towards the movement's casualties." <i>The New York Review of Books</i><br><br>"The descriptions [of] the 'therapeutic' practices by which memories are recovered are a frightening indictment of at least some members of the burgeoning industry." <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"[A] thoughtful, scholarly book . . . concerned with exposing the damage caused by, and the falsity of, the practice of recovered-memory therapy." <i>The Washington Post Book World</i><br> -- <i>Review</i><br><br>"Astute, scientifically informed, and compassionate towards the movement's casualties." <i>The New York Review of Books</i><br><br>"The descriptions [of] the 'therapeutic' practices by which memories are recovered are a frightening indictment of at least some members of the burgeoning industry." <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"[A] thoughtful, scholarly book . . . concerned with exposing the damage caused by, and the falsity of, the practice of recovered-memory therapy." <i>The Washington Post Book World</i><br> --The New York Review of Books<br><br>"Astute, scientifically informed, and compassionate towards the movement's casualties." <i>The New York Review of Books</i><br><br>"The descriptions [of] the 'therapeutic' practices by which memories are recovered are a frightening indictment of at least some members of the burgeoning industry." <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"[A] thoughtful, scholarly book . . . concerned with exposing the damage caused by, and the falsity of, the practice of recovered-memory therapy." <i>The Washington Post Book World</i><br> --The New York Review of Books<br><br>"Astute, scientifically informed, and compassionate towards the movement's casualties." <i>The New York Review of Books</i><br><br>"The descriptions [of] the 'therapeutic' practices by which memories are recovered are a frightening indictment of at least some members of the burgeoning industry." <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"[A] thoughtful, scholarly book . . . concerned with exposing the damage caused by, and the falsity of, the practice of recovered-memory therapy." <i>The Washington Post Book World</i><br> --The New York Times</p><h2>The Havemeyers: Impressionism Comes to America</h2><p>The first biography of the couple who created the landmark collection that is still the base of most American museums</p><p></p><h2>Kids Who Carry Our Pain: Breaking the Cycle of Codependency for the Next Generation (Minirth-Meier Clinic Series)</h2><p>For Ingest Only - Data needs to be cleaned up for all products being loaded</p><p></p><h2>In Theory: Classes, Nations, Literatures</h2><p>After the Second World War, nationalism emerged as the principle expression of resistance to Western imperialism in a variety of regions from the Indian subcontinent to Africa, to parts of Latin America and the Pacific Rim.

Andouille. Country ham. The extraordinary rise in popularity of cured meats in recent years often overlooks the fact that the ancient practice of meat preservation through the use of salt, time, and smoke began as a survival technique. All over the world, various cultures developed ways to extend the viability of the hunt&#x2015;and later the harvest&#x2015;according to their unique climates and environments, resulting in the astonishing diversity of preserved meats that we celebrate and enjoy today everywhere from corner delis to white-tablecloth restaurants.</p> <p>In <em>Salted and Cured</em>, author Jeffrey P. Roberts traces the origins of today&#x2019;s American charcuterie, salumi, and other delights, and connects them to a current renaissance that begins to rival those of artisan cheese and craft beer. In doing so, Roberts highlights the incredible stories of immigrant butchers, breeders, chefs, entrepreneurs, and other craftspeople who withstood the modern era&#x2019;s push for bland, industrial food to produce not only delicious but culturally significant cured meats.</p> <p>By rejecting the industry-led push for &#x201c;the other white meat&#x201d; and reinvigorating the breeding and production of heritage hog breeds while finding novel ways to utilize the entire animal&#x2015;snout to tail&#x2015;today&#x2019;s charcutiers and salumieri not only produce everything from country ham to <em>violino di capra</em> but create more sustainable businesses for farmers and chefs.</p> <p>Weaving together agriculture, animal welfare and health, food safety and science, economics, history, a deep sense of place, and amazing preserved foods, <em>Salted and Cured</em> is a literary feast, a celebration of both innovation and time-honored knowledge, and an expertly guided tour of America&#x2019;s culinary treasures, both old and new.</p></p><p><p>A resident of Montpelier, Vermont, Jeff Roberts is president of Cow Creek Creative Ventures, which is dedicated to developing solutions in the areas of agriculture and food policy, conservation, the environment, and community economic development.

Now preserved meats are bleeping bright on food lovers&#x2019; radar&#x2015;those salted, cured, and smoked meats traditional in most cultures, but which had fallen out of favor with health-conscious Americans in recent decades. Jeffrey P. Roberts, a Slow Food activist and food historian, debunks these fears about cholesterol and nitrates, and surveys the renaissance in locally produced salumi and charcuterie throughout the United States. Part history, part travelogue, Salted and Cured documents how farmers, butchers, and chefs nurture each other in the production of high-quality, sustainably sourced preserved meats in a variety of cultural and regional traditions. The author used his myriad connections to research a porkophile&#x2019;s dream journey, investigating the making of country hams in Virginia, the boudin and andouille sausage of New Orleans, the wurst of German and Slavic butcher shops of New York City, and the glories of the Midwestern meat-packing capitals. As more restaurant patrons and home cooks turn up their noses at the foodstuffs of industrialized agriculture, demand for meat that has been locally and humanely raised has increased. These products take time to age and cure properly and are most often sourced from small farms with slower-growing heritage breeds: a recipe for how production is currently far outstripped by public demand. Add in the rediscovery of what food writer Anthony Bourdain dubs &#x201c;the nasty bits&#x201d; (offal and other snout-to-tail parts of the piggy carcass), utilized lovingly and most fully in sausages and salamis, and you can see why these preserved meats are so popular today. An extensive bibliography, endnotes, photographs, and a list of producers offer opportunities to further explore unfamiliar types of meat products. The glossary at the back also helps reinforce the differences between salami and salumi, lardo and lomo, and all the spectacular meat treats in between."</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;The survival skills of salting and curing gave our forefathers the ability to settle in a new country while attempting to dodge starvation.

This is Gino's way of answering all the questions that people ask him about Italian food. It is a cookbook of modern Italian recipes, infused with Gino's easy, infectious style. The chapters reflect Gino's attitude to life as well as food, ranging from Legs &amp; Feathers to Something Fishy, Sunshine &amp; Salads to a Bit on the Side. <p>Firstly, says Gino, cooking comes from the heart. if you're not in a good mood, get a takeaway! Secondly, spend less time cooking and more time buying the right ingredients. If you have good ingredients, you don't need to spend hours adding flavor to them. And rule number three: don't use too many strong flavors in a dish - you should be able to taste and appreciate each ingredient.</p>I grew up in the south of Italy surrounded by a very large family, so it is no wonder that I became passionate about food. The food we ate was very traditional; simple recipes based on fresh and healthy fruit, vegetables, fish, and meat. In the summer of 1987 when I was eleven, I walked into my grandfather's restaurant for the first time and that's when I decided that this was the career for me too. <p>To me there is nothing more satisfying than seeing people enjoy a meal that you have created. That is why I decided to write this book - so that everyone can enjoy the same experience. There is a chef in each and every one of us, even if you don't know it yet! I hope this book will prove to you that you don't need to spend a lot of time in the kitchen to enjoy a good Italian meal. It will also give you a good idea of the food you will find in Italy now. I have chosen some traditional recipes, exactly as my grandfather would have cooked them, some modern dishes, sometimes with a twist of my own, and a few that have been influenced by food that I love from other countries. None of the recipes are complicated or fussy - by the time you have tried them you will understand my motto - Minimum Effort, Maximum Satisfaction.

It describes her tempestuous early years in parochial Sydney, her escape to London, the discovery of love with Bill Blake, Paris in the 1920s and the move to New York. After the war they returned to Europe but moved restlessly from place to place. Then, in 1965, &#34;The Man Who Loved Children&#34; was reissued, turning Stead into an international celebrity.</p><p>Hazel Rowley is currently in residence at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center of the University of Texas.An absorbing biography that will help Stead's fans place her fiction in the context of her life and may well attract new readers to her work. Christina Stead (190283), who was born and died in Australia (about which, writes Rowley, she was ``both nostalgic and patronising''), did her writing during her years in Europe and the US. Although she tapped real events and people for her fiction--and not just for her autobiographical novels, including the superb The Man Who Loved Children--she could be secretive in her private papers, identifying people by fictional names, writing in code, and ultimately destroying many documents. Despite this obstacle, Rowley (an Australian academic, currently a visiting scholar at Columbia University) offers a coherent and convincing portrait that reaches back into a youth in which Stead was overshadowed by her father, who first instilled in her a lifelong socialist orientation, insecurity about her appearance (he dubbed her ``Pig Face''), and a yearning to be adored by a man. When she arrived in London in 1928, Stead found just the man--William Blake (originally Blech), whom Rowley succinctly describes as a ``Marxist investments manager who seemed to know something about everything.'' Blake hired her to be his secretary, and Stead accompanied him to Paris, where their romance flourished--despite a wife who would not divorce Blake for 23 years. When the bank employing Blake collapsed, the pair fled to New York. Stead's writings earned only modest royalties even when favorably reviewed, and Blake could not find work, so they returned to Europe in a consistently difficult hunt for economic security that gave their lives a nomadic flavor. By 1949, Stead said to a friend, ``I have been a writer, quite unsuccessfully for twenty years,'' although a revival of interest in her work, which began in the mid-1960s, helped her return to Australia in 1969 as a famous author and ``Official Personage.'' A welcome study of an underrated author. (16 pages of photos, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The lawyer-notary who has always adored her tells this melancholy tale from the distance of old age, unassuaged love and undiminished pain. Flora cannot return his love because she has bestowed her own on the poet-peasant Gildas Caussinade, already lionized in Paris, praised by Musset and Sand. He, poor fool, has fallen helplessly into the coils of Flora's maidservant, the seductress Martha. Who could have know that the fateful triangle would come to great grief: Flora and Gildas, about to marry, are astoundingly foiled by Martha's announcement that the darling of the salons is already married, to her. Reason enough for Gildas to slaughter himself and for Flora, like other romantic heroines, to go mad and soon after die of it. In the tradition of costume meldodramas, Sagan's characters strike attitudes and deliver stock speeches, clutch their bosoms and sigh deeply.

Some of the points covered include: 1. We can be so busy trying to be like Christ and trying to do His work that we disallow His work in us. 2. Instead of representing heaven, Canaan represents the victory we can have now on earth. 3. Christ did not come to improve self, He came to replace it. 4. The Christian is of no use to God unless he is dead to self. 5. God does not need a greatness in numbers to get His job done. 6. The devil is a hinderer, deceiver, and an accuser. The secret to defeating him is &#34;Christ in you, the hope of glory!&#34; 7. We need to accept the fact of our indequacy and praise the Lord for His adequacy in us.

Groen not only developed a political philosophy based solidly in Reformation truths but he also formed a political party to bring those truths to bear in the political forum of his day. Then, as now, the battle was against the Revolution: "the invasion of the human mind by the doctrine of the absolute sovereignty of man, thus making him the source and centre of all truth, by substituting human reason and human will for divine revelation and divine law." It is "the history of the irreligious philosophy of the past century; it is, in its origin and outworking, the doctrine that&#x2014;given free rein&#x2014;destroys church and state, society and family, produces disorder without ever establishing liberty or restoring moral order, and, in religion, inevitably leads its conscientious followers into atheism and despair."Against the Revolution there is only one antidote: the Gospel. To proclaim and elaborate this truth was Groen van Prinsterer's life work. This volume&#x2014;never before published in English&#x2014;is an adept summary of it.</p><p></p><h2>Creating Canada Student Resource</h2><p>* Engaging students through a visually appealing and accessible design * Making History relevant to students by developing Historical and Critical Thinking skills * Providing teachers with flexible course-planning options and ready-made lesson plans * Giving all students opportunities for success by supporting differentiated instruction * Using technology to enhance student and teacher experience</p><p></p><h2>Nosotros: The Hispanic People of Oregon</h2><p><i>Nosotros</i> offers a variety of perspectives on Oregon's multifaceted Hispanic community.

The world of Santhenar is under attack from the Void by the lyrinx, giant winged intelligent carnivores, and generations of war have turned human society into a totalitarian spy-state with the front line of the war held over all men and so-called &#34;Breeding Factories&#34; held as a threat over women. Tiaan is a brilliant young artisan in a munitions factory whom the authorities are deliberately pressuring into excelling herself; when she falls foul of her rival Iriis and the apprentice spy Nish, events are set in chain which jeopardise the humanity of two worlds. * Irvine&#39;s strength here is that he makes us care not only about the idealistic, wet, misguidedly ruthless Tiaan, but also about the occasionally vicious and manipulative Iriis and Nish, who are not merely villains, but products of their unpleasant world so * Ian Irvine has produced one of those rarities in the fantasy genre, and that is a unique, well-thought-through world coupled to a well-written storyline. A gripping read for Irvine fans, or a fresh new series for any other readers. * ENIGMA * A page-turner of the highest order ... Irvine can now consider himself comfortably ranked next to the works of Robert Jordan and David Eddings. Formidable * SFX *</p><h2>Burning Paradise</h2><p>Stated first edition. A new copy in dust jacket. By the Hugo winning author of &#34;Spin&#34;.</p><p><p>Born in California, ROBERT CHARLES WILSON grew up in Canada. He is the author of many acclaimed SF novels, including <i>Darwinia</i>, <i>Blind Lake</i>, <i>Julian Comstock</i>, and the Hugo Award&#x2013;winning <i>Spin</i>.</p>1<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>BUFFALO, NEW YORK<br>Everything that followed might have happened differently&#x2014;or might not have happened at all&#x2014;had Cassie been able to sleep that night.<br>She had tried to sleep, had <i>wanted</i> to sleep, had dutifully gone to bed at 11:30, but now it was three hours and some minutes past midnight and her thoughts were running like hamsters in an exercise wheel. She stood up, switched on the light, dressed herself in gray sweat pants and a yellow flannel shirt, and padded barefoot down the chilly parquet floor of the hallway to the kitchen.<br>Unusually, she was alone in the apartment. Except for Thomas, of course. Thomas was her little brother, twelve years old and soundly asleep in the second bedroom, a negligible presence. Cassie and Thomas lived with their aunt Nerissa, and Cassie still thought of this as Aunt Ris&#x2019;s apartment although it had been her home for almost seven years now. Usually her aunt would have been asleep on the fold-out sofa in the living room, but tonight Aunt Ris was on a date, which meant she might not be back until Saturday afternoon.<br>Cassie had welcomed the chance to spend some time alone. She was eighteen years old, had graduated from high school last spring, worked days at Lassiter&#x2019;s Department Store three blocks away, and was legally and functionally an adult, but her aunt&#x2019;s protectiveness remained a force to be reckoned with. Aunt Ris had made a completely unnecessary fuss about going out: <i>You&#x2019;ll be all right?</i> Yes. <i>Are you sure?</i> Of course. <i>You&#x2019;ll keep a close eye on Thomas?</i> Yes! Go! Have a good time! Don&#x2019;t worry about us!<br>The evening had passed quickly and pleasantly. There was no television in the apartment, but she had played records after dinner. Bach&#x2019;s <i>Well-Tempered Clavier</i> had the useful effect of making Thomas drowsy even as it rang in Cassie&#x2019;s head like the tolling of a divine bell, echoing even after Thomas was in bed and the house was eerily quiet. Then she had turned off most of the lights except for the lamp on the living-room end table and had huddled on the sofa with a bowl of popcorn and a book until she was tired enough to turn in.<br>So why was she prowling around now like a nervous cat? Cassie opened the refrigerator door. Nothing inside seemed appetizing. The linoleum floor was cold under her feet. She should have put on slippers.<br>She scooted a kitchen chair next to the window and sat down, resting her elbows on the dusty sill. The corpses of six summer flies lay interred behind the sash-tied cotton blind. &#x201c;Disgusting,&#x201d; Cassie said quietly. November had been windy and cold, and wisps of late-autumn air slipped through the single-pane window like probing fingers.<br>The window overlooked Liberty Street. Aunt Ris&#x2019;s apartment occupied the floor above a store that sold and repaired secondhand furniture, in a two-story brick building like every other building on the block. The next-door neighbors were a Chinese restaurant on the north side and a grubby antique shop on the south. From where she sat Cassie could see the wide glass display windows of the Groceteria and a half dozen other businesses on the north side of Liberty, all the way to Pippin Street and Antioch Avenue. Not much traffic this time of night, but the after-hours clubs in the entertainment district were just closing. On other sleepless Fridays&#x2014;Cassie was a restless sleeper at the best of times&#x2014;she had watched cars rolling through red lights in drunken oblivion, had heard drivers gunning their engines in mad displays of masculine enthusiasm. But just now the street was silent and empty. Of pedestrians there were none.<br>Or, she corrected herself, no. There was <i>one</i> pedestrian: a man standing alone in the mouth of the narrow alley that separated the Groceteria from Tuck&#x2019;s Used Books.<br>Cassie hadn&#x2019;t seen him at first because of the Armistice Day banners strapped to the high standards of the streetlights. The city had put up the banners a couple of days ago. There was a parade every year to mark the 1914 Armistice, but this year the city (the state, the nation, the world in general) was making a big deal out of the centenary: one hundred years of peace. Relative peace. Approximate peace.<br>Cassie had always loved Armistice Day. Next to Christmas, it was her favorite holiday. She still remembered her parents taking her to watch the parade back in Boston&#x2014;remembered the sidewalk vendors who sold roasted chestnuts in twists of paper, the Floats of the Nations populated by schoolchildren in implausibly colorful ethnic dress, the battling cacophonies of high-school marching bands. The violent death of her mother and father had taught Cassie things about the world that would never be acknowledged in any Armistice Day parade, but she still felt the bittersweet tug of those times.<br>The Centennial banner flapped in a brisk wind, alternately revealing and concealing the man in the shadows. Now that Cassie had seen him she couldn&#x2019;t look away. He was a drab man, an ordinary man, probably a businessman, dressed for the season in a gray coat down to his knees and with a fedora on his head, but what unsettled Cassie was the impression that <i>he had been looking up at her</i>&#x2014;that he had turned his head away the moment she had seen him.<br>Well, but why not? At this hour, hers might be the only lighted window on the block. Why shouldn&#x2019;t it catch his eye? It was only deeply ingrained habit that made her suspicious. Aunt Ris and the other local survivors of the Correspondence Society had trained Cassie in their secret protocols, of which the first rule was the simplest: <i>Beware the attention of strangers.</i><br>The solitary stranger was no longer looking at her window, but his attention still seemed fixed on the building where she lived. His gaze was flat and unwavering and on closer inspection subtly lunatic. Cassie felt a knot tighten in her stomach. This <i>would</i> happen on a night when Aunt Ris was out. Not that anything had really <i>happened,</i> but it would have been nice to have a second opinion to call on. Should she really be worried about a lone man standing in the windy street after midnight? It was a calculation difficult to make when she was too conscious of the empty rooms around her and the shadows they contained.<br>These thoughts were so absorbing that she was startled when the wind lifted the Armistice Day banner once more and she saw that the man had moved. He had taken a few steps out of the alley and across the sidewalk; he was standing at the edge of Liberty Street now, the toes of his brown shoes poised where the curb met the gutter. His face was upturned once again, and although Cassie couldn&#x2019;t see his eyes she imagined she felt the pressure of their attention as he scanned the building. She ducked away from the window, crossed the kitchen floor and switched off the overhead light. Now <i>she</i> could watch <i>him</i> from the shadows.<br>During the time it took her to return to her chair by the window he had moved only slightly, one foot on the sidewalk, one foot in the street. What next? Was he armed? Would he cross the street, come inside the building, knock on the door of the apartment, try to break it down if she refused to let him in? If so, Cassie knew what to do: grab Thomas and leave by the fire escape. Once she was sure she wasn&#x2019;t being followed she would hurry to the home of the nearest Society member&nbsp;... even though the nearest Society member was the disagreeable Leo Beck, who lived in a cheap apartment five blocks closer to the lake.<br>But the man seemed to hesitate again. Would a killer hesitate? Of course, she had no real reason to believe he was a murderer or a simulacrum. There had been no violence since the flurry of killings seven years ago. Probably the man was just a drunk disappointed by a luckless night at the bars, or maybe an insomniac with a mind as restless as her own. His interest in the building where she lived might be only an optical illusion; he could have been staring at his own sad reflection in the window of Pike Brothers Furniture Restoration and Sales.<br>He took another step into the street just as a car turned the corner from Pippin onto Liberty. The car was a dark-colored sedan, blue or black, she couldn&#x2019;t tell which under the uncertain light of the streetlamps. The driver gunned the engine crazily and the car fishtailed as it took the corner. Cassie supposed the driver must be drunk.<br>But the solitary stranger didn&#x2019;t seem to notice. He began to stride across the street as if he had suddenly made up his mind, while the car sped on heedlessly. Cassie looked from the vehicle to the pedestrian, calculating the obvious trajectory but not quite believing it. Surely the car would swerve at the last minute? Or the stranger would turn and leap out of the way?<br>But neither of these things happened.<br>The Armistice Day banner flapped twice in the November wind. Cassie pressed her forehead against the chill glass of the window. Her hands gripped the fly-littered sill, and she watched with sick anticipation as the collision evolved from possibility to inevitability to sickening fact.<br>The car&#x2019;s fender took the pedestrian at knee level. He dropped and rolled under the grille as if he had been inhaled by it. For one awful moment he simply vanished. All Cassie could see&#x2014;resisting an almost overpowering urge to close her eyes&#x2014;was the double bounce of the car&#x2019;s suspension as its wheels passed over him. She heard the shrilling of the brakes. The car swerved sidelong before it came to a stop. White smoke billowed from the exhaust pipe and swirled away in the wind. The driver turned off the engine, and silence was briefly restored to Liberty Street.<br>The pedestrian wasn&#x2019;t just hurt&#x2014;he was dying, was probably already dead. Cassie forced herself to look. His neck was broken, his head skewed so that he seemed to be staring at his own left shoulder. His chest had been crushed and split. Only his legs seemed completely intact&#x2014;a perfectly good pair of legs, Cassie thought madly.<br>The car door swung open and the driver lurched out. The driver was a young man in a disheveled suit. His collar was open and he wore no tie. He leaned on the hood of the car to steady himself. He shook his head twice. He looked at the remains of the pedestrian, then looked away as if from a blinding light. The Armistice banner (CELEBRATING A CENTURY OF PEACE) flapped above him with a popping sound that made Cassie think of gunfire. The driver opened his mouth as if to speak. Then he doubled over and delivered the contents of his stomach onto the asphalt of Liberty Street.<br>The dead man had made a far bigger mess. There was a lot of blood. Blood everywhere. But not <i>just</i> blood. Something else had come out of him&#x2014;a syrupy green fluid that steamed in the night air.<br>Cassie stood silent and rigid, the events she had witnessed doubling in her mind with a memory of other deaths, far away, years ago.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>Because she had to be sure&#x2014;because there must be no mistake this time&#x2014;she threw a jacket over her flannel shirt and hurried down the stairs that led from Aunt Ris&#x2019;s apartment to the small tiled lobby and the street door.<br>She opened the door just a crack. She dared not leave the building while Thomas was asleep. She just needed to be sure she had seen what she thought she had seen.<br>Cold air rushed past her. The popping of the Armistice banner was angry and random. The driver sat on the hood of his car, sobbing. Lights had begun to wink on in upper-story apartments all along the street. Faces like pale or occulted moons appeared at windows. The police would be here before long, Cassie supposed.<br>She put her head out far enough to get a good look at the corpse of the pedestrian.<br>One of the last monographs circulated by the Correspondence Society&#x2014;it had been written after the killings&#x2014;had been <i>Notes on the Physical Anatomy of a Simulacrum.</i> The author was Werner Beck, the wealthy father of Leo Beck. Of course Cassie hadn&#x2019;t read it at the time, but last winter she had found a copy among Aunt Ris&#x2019;s keepsakes and had studied it carefully. She could recite parts of it from memory. <i>The lungs, heart, and digestive system, along with the skeleton and musculature, comprise the simulacrum&#x2019;s only identifiable internal organs. Those organs are contained in an amorphous green matrix, covered in turn by layers of adipose tissue and human skin. The rudimentary circulatory system produces less bleeding with traumatic injury, and it is not obvious that even massive blood loss would be immediately fatal to a simulacrum. The undifferentiated green matter suffuses much of the chest and abdominal cavity as well as most of the interior of the skull. It evaporates on exposure to air, leaving a pliant green film of desiccated cells.</i><br>Werner Beck had written that, and he would know: he had wounded one of the things in his home with a shotgun, then had retained the presence of mind to attempt a dissection.<br>The mess in the street was consistent with his description, and Cassie tried to look at it with the same soldierly dispassion. Blood, but not as much as you might expect. Yellowish fatty tissue. And the green &#x201c;matrix,&#x201d; which was everywhere. Cassie could smell it. She had a fleeting memory of her mother, who had cultivated roses every summer and occasionally recruited Cassie in her garden work. At the age of eight Cassie had spent one endless afternoon pinching aphids and thrips from the leaves and stems of Alba roses, until her hands were coated with an aromatic grime of chlorophyll, garden loam, leafy matter and insect parts. The smell had lingered on her hands for hours even after she washed them with soap and water.<br>That was what the dead pedestrian smelled like.<br>Mrs. Theodorus, who lived over a shoe store on the opposite side of the street, emerged onto the sidewalk wearing a pink nighty and fuzzy white slippers. She seemed about to scold the weeping driver for disturbing her sleep, but stopped when she came within sight of the corpse. She stared at it for a long moment. Then she put her hand to her mouth, stifling a scream.<br>Above all these sounds&#x2014;Mrs. Theodorus&#x2019;s scream, the driver&#x2019;s sobs, the popping banner&#x2014;Cassie heard the distant howl of a police siren, louder by the second.<br><i>Time to leave,</i> she thought. She was surprisingly calm. It was a mechanical calm, as exact as algebra, beneath which Cassie felt panic gliding like a shark in a sunny estuary. But she couldn&#x2019;t afford the luxury of panic. Her life was at stake. Hers, and Thomas&#x2019;s.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br><i>In a crisis always assume the worst,</i> Aunt Ris had taught her, and Cassie tried to do that, which meant she had to believe that another general attack was underway. And this time no one associated with the Society would be spared. If not for a fortunate accident, the simulacrum who was currently spread across Liberty Street like a sloppy green-and-red compote would have come to the apartment and killed Cassie and Thomas. Aunt Ris might already be dead, a possibility Cassie refused to dwell on for more than a moment. At best, Aunt Ris would come home to an empty apartment and the discovery that her life had changed yet again, irrevocably and for the worse.<br><i>I could wait for her,</i> Cassie reasoned. A Friday night date meant her aunt probably wouldn&#x2019;t be back ...</p><h2>Catching Breath: The Making and Unmaking of Tuberculosis (Bloomsbury Sigma)</h2><p><p>With more than a million victims every year--more than any other disease, including malaria--and antibiotic resistance now found in every country worldwide, tuberculosis is once again proving itself to be one of the smartest killers that humanity has ever faced. But it's hardly surprising considering how long it's had to hone its skills. Forty-thousand years ago, our ancestors set off from the cradle of civilization on their journey towards populating the planet. Tuberculosis hitched a lift and came with us, and it's been there ever since; waiting, watching, and learning. </p><p>The organism responsible, <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, has had plenty of time to adapt to its chosen habitat--human lungs--and has learned through natural selection to be an almost perfect pathogen. Using our own immune cells as a Trojan Horse to aid its spread, it's come up with clever ways to avoid being killed by antibiotics. But patience has been its biggest lesson--it can enter into a latent state when times are tough, only to come back to life when a host's immune system is compromised. Today, more than one million people die of the disease every year and around one-third of the world's population are believed to be infected. That's more than two billion people. Throw in the compounding problems of drug resistance, the HIV epidemic, and poverty, and it's clear that tuberculosis remains one of the most serious problems in world medicine. </p><p><i>Catching Breath</i> follows the history of TB through the ages, from its time as an infection of hunter-gatherers to the first human villages, which set it up with everything it needed to become the monstrous disease it is today, through to the perils of industrialization and urbanization. It goes on to look at the latest research in fighting the disease, with stories of modern scientific research, interviews with doctors on the TB frontline, and the personal experiences of those affected by the disease.</p></p><p><b>Kathryn Lougheed </b>worked in tuberculosis research for more than ten years, focusing on the biological mechanisms of latent tuberculosis. She completed her Ph.D. at Imperial College London, and worked at the National Institute for Medical Research where she collaborated with industrial partners to develop inhibitors targeted against <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>. Lougheed has published dozens of peer-reviewed papers and was an active member of the tuberculosis research community. This is her first book and she lives in London, England.<p>"With humor and clarity, she skillfully distills the complex science surrounding mycobacterium TB into a comprehensible narrative . . . sure to be appreciated by scientists as well as lay people interested in learning more about this persistent disease." - <i>Library Journal</i></p><p>". . . an expert account . . ." - <i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>"Not just a medical history but a call to action." - <i>Kirkus</i></p><p>"Lougheed sets out the statistics calmly but returns to their enormity as she delivers on her aim to raise the profile of this prolific killer . . .

Sloane&#39;s Bicycle Maintenance Manual (Fireside Books (Holiday House))</h2><p>Loaded with all new information on equipment, tools, and the latest in bicycle technology. Sloane&#39;s New Bicycle Maintenance Manual is a must for cyclists of all levels of experience. Mending a falt, building a wheel, and installing a chain are just a few of the many projects that can be tackled at home thanks to Sloane&#39;s accessible instructions and detailed illustrations. Black-and-white photographs and line drawings.</p><p>Sloane's Complete Book of All-Terrain Bicycles is a new edition (S. &amp; S., 1985) of the author's guide to purchasing, riding, and performing basic maintenance on mountain bikes. The book's narrow scope is justified, since mountain bikes require different criteria for fit and riding technique than their road-going cousins. Sloane flies off on some interesting tangents, e.g., providing advice on how to signal passing airplanes with a tree limb if lost in the wild. On the whole, though, his guide is a useful addition to the literature and is recommended for public libraries. Maintenance is another matter. Mountain bikes are, after all, bikes, and therefore if you can maintain a road bike you can do the same to a mountain bike. The focus of Sloane's New Bicycle Maintenance Manual (S. &amp; S., 1981) is general bike maintenance. Practices covered include keeping brakes and frame safe; adjusting derailleurs (including index systems); lubing and repacking bottom brackets, hubs, and headsets; caring for chains and freewheel, pedals, saddles, handlebars, cables, tires; and trueing and building wheels. While the information here is adequate and Sloane's writing is clear, the same coverage can be found in a number of standard sources libraries may own (e.g., Glenn's Complete Bicycle Manual , LJ 7/73; Bicycling's Complete Guide to Bicycle Maintenance &amp; Repair , LJ 5/1/86; and Anybody's Bike Book , LJ 11/1/90). Recommended for collections lacking one of the above. (Illustrations not seen.)-- Thomas K.

Captain Robert B. Heinen was exposed as one of the three during a senate subcommittee investigation of the IRS. Thus began an investigation of Heinen that lasted for seven years, the same years that he was methodically knocking out various rackets controlled by the Mafia; the underworld organization the IRS acussed him of consorting with. In this candid, unusual book, Captain Heinen reveals his remarkable life of nearly three decades on the Kansas city Missouri Police Department. After serving four years in the navy during WWII he joined the KCPD and became disillusioned with the thieves and grafters among the officers. The Battle Behind the Badge is a personal account of a man who tried to hold to the ideals he learned while growing up in a typical American rural town, where simple values such as honesty are the rule, and a man&#39;s word is his bond.</p><p></p><h2>Spell of the Tiger: The Man-Eaters of Sundarbans</h2><p>Citing the predatory relationship between India Bay&#39;s Bengal tigers and the natives of Sundarbans, a study notes how the tigers are worshipped by the people there and recounts the many legends that associate the tigers with supernatural qualities</p><p>Sy Montgomery is an author, naturalist, newspaper columnist, documentary scriptwriter, and radio commentator who writes for children as well as adults. Among her award-winning books are The Snake Scientist and The Man-Eating Tigers of Sundarbans. She made four expeditions to Peru and Brazil to study the pink dolphins of the Amazon. She lives in New Hampshire.Tigers have always been associated with magic and other manifestations of the divine, but nowhere on earth do tigers make their power felt more tangibly than in Sundarbans, the world's largest tidal delta and mangrove swamp on the Bay of Bengal. Here, in this mysterious, amphibious realm, tigers hunt men, killing dozens, even hundreds a year. Montgomery, author of Walking with the Great Apes (1991) and other nature-related works, traveled to Sundarbans to try to understand this baffling, terrifying, and inexplicably tolerated relationship between man and beast. Her quest proved maddeningly difficult. She could barely communicate with her guides, and the tigers were as elusive as their reputation dictates. But as she spent day after day floating down tributaries and creeks and staring into the forest, Montgomery began to absorb the unique and surprisingly cosmic dynamic of the delta. Thus the hair-raising stories she tells about tigers stalking and killing men as they fish or collect wood and honey stand in curious counterpoint to her deeply moving explanations of the spiritual attitude the people of Sundarbans express toward their mighty foe, a mix of fear, respect, and worship. After all, there can be no revelation more humbling than the recognition that we, like other animals, are meat. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>The Secret World of Og</h2><p>The Canadian Classic, written by Pierre Berton and illustrated by his daughter, Patsy is now a 26 episode animated children&#x2019;s series on CBC television beginning Saturday, September 9, 2006.

In the first single-authored monograph on the topic of the Marvel cinematic universe, Terence McSweeney asks, "Why has the superhero genre reemerged so emphatically in recent years?" In an age where people have stopped going to the cinema as frequently as they used to, they returned to it in droves for the superhero film. What is it about these films that has resonated with audiences all around the globe? Are they just disposable pop culture artifacts or might they have something interesting to say about the fears and anxieties of the world we live in today?<br><br>Beginning with <i>Iron Man</i> in 2008, this study provocatively explores both the cinematic and the televisual branches of the series across ten dynamic and original chapters from a diverse range of critical perspectives which analyse their status as an embodiment of the changing industrial practices of the blockbuster film and their symbolic potency as affective cultural artifacts that are profoundly immersed in the turbulent political climate of their era.</p><p>Terence McSweeney is senior lecturer in Media Arts and Technology at Southampton Solent University. He is the author of <i>The War on Terror and American Film: 9/11 Frames per Second'</i> (Edinburgh University Press, 2014), <i>Beyond the Frame: The Films and Film Theory of Andrei Tarkovsky </i>(Aporetic Press, 2015) and the co-editor of <i>Millennial Cinema: Memory in Global</i> <i>Film </i>(Wallflower, 2012).A magnificent book. As insightful and comprehensive as it is engaging and timely, this full-length examination of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is a rewarding read for passionate superhero fans as well as researchers in the fields of film studies, political science, and cultural studies. (Marc DiPaolo, Southwestern Oklahoma State University, author of <i>War, Politics, and Superheroes: Ethics and Propaganda in Comics and Film</i>)<br><br>This is a timely and entertaining volume that will prove very useful in the development of genre courses in the next few years as the superhero genre finds its place in taught modules across film and media programmes. The work is scholarly and well referenced in ways that open it to further reading and research, but accessible to undergraduate readers. The author takes an epistemically specific approach that is not inappropriate given the avowed focus on the MCU specifically, rather than the superhero genre on the whole or its historical roots. As such, the range of contemporary readings on terrorism, conflict, and the power structures of the twenty first century (mainly American) is again both timely and informative. Intellectually, the breaking of the MCU into its industrially determined &#x2018;phases&#x2019; again focuses the chronology but also opens new arenas of interrogation. The &#x2018;phase two&#x2019; section demonstrates the degree to which the frames of reference change between 2008 and 2013, freeing the franchise (and scholarly debate) from some of the immediate trauma narrative tropes of the first phase, and allowing the discussion to delve into some of the more liminal spaces of the MCU, such as in <i>Thor: The Dark World</i> and <i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i> on gender and fantasy. The final section on the recent television incarnations of the franchise is useful without delving too deeply into the political economy of transmedia in the Netflix age (which is another topic entirely) (Harvey O'Brien, University College.

The Catholic townsfolk blame their Jewish neighbors, so to save them from the rioting mob, the Cambridge Jews are placed under the protection of the king. King Henry II is no friend of the Jews&#x2014;or anyone, really&#x2014;but he believes in law and order, and he desperately needs the taxes he receives from Jewish merchants. Hoping scientific investigation will catch the true killer, Henry calls on his cousin, the King of Sicily&#x2014;whose subjects include the best medical experts in Europe&#x2014;and asks for his finest "master of the art of death," the earliest form of medical examiner. The Italian doctor chosen for the task is a young prodigy from the University of Salerno, an expert in the science of anatomy and the art of detection. But her name is Adelia; the king has been sent a "mistress of the art of death." <p>In a backward and superstitious country like England, Adelia faces danger at every turn. As she examines the victims and retraces their last steps, Adelia must conceal her true identity in order to avoid accusations of witchcraft. Along the way, she&#x2019;s assisted by one of the king&#x2019;s tax collectors, Sir Rowley Picot, a man with a personal stake in the investigation. A former Crusader knight, Rowley may be a needed friend ... or the fiend for whom they are searching. As Adelia&#x2019;s investigation takes her along Cambridge&#x2019;s shadowy river paths, and behind the closed doors of its churches and nunneries, the hunt intensifies and the killer prepares to strike again...</p></p><p>Ariana Franklin was the pen name of British writer Diana Norman. A former journalist, Norman had written several critically acclaimed biographies and historical novels. She lived in Hertfordshire, England, with her husband, the film critic Barry Norman. Ariana was the author of the acclaimed, award-winning Mistress of the Art of Death series. She passed away in 2011, before she was able to deliver the manuscript for Winter Siege. Her daughter, Samantha, who began working life in publishing as a junior editor in children&#39;s books before moving in to freelance journalism, decided to complete the novel on her mother&#39;s behalf. Samantha Norman is a journalist and broadcaster who is mad about horses. She lives in west London with her two sons Harry and Charlie, and their dogs Becks and Spider.Rosalyn Landor narrates a complex story that merges history, mystery, human rights, feminism, and a touch of romance. Adelia, who is educated in forensics of the period, is sent with a Jewish detective and Muslim eunuch bodyguard to clear the Jews of Cambridge, England, who are accused of murdering Christian children. Landor navigates the tension and tenderness of a headstrong Italian woman caught between cultures and the clash of science and religion. Landor steers listeners skillfully through Adelia's desire to understand what has taken place and her horror at the deeds of a mass murderer. Landor's portrayal reflects Adelia's struggle to maintain scientific detachment in the face of disease, death, and her attraction to a Crusader whom she suspects.

We sat down to spuds with mince and onions, followed by whisky and a game of poker in front of a coal fire. If I&#x2019;m not careful, I thought, as the cards slapped onto the table, I could lose the whole afternoon. I resolved not to&#x2014;but within minutes the whisky and the warmth had drained all the willpower out of me. <br><br> Over the card play, as coals glowed in the hearth and a waitress in an apron and bonnet supplied us with ice for the Scotch, I listened as Krick told me his remarkable life story. I had taken an unlikely route into meteorology, but his was far stranger. After taking a physics degree at the University of California he worked as a disc jockey, then as a runner for a company of stockbrokers. <br> <br>&#x201c;Chapman de Wolfe and Company,&#x201d;he said,pronouncing it &#x201c;Volf &#x201d; in the German way. &#x201c;As you can imagine, my services were dispensed with pretty rapidly after the Crash in &#x2019;twenty-nine. Though I missed the worst of it on my own account.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;How?&#x201d; I asked, leaning forward. <br><br> He grinned, slicking his hair back. &#x201c;I devised a system calibrating financial fluctuations against background randomness, according to certain physical principles. Things have changed a bit since then, but I still use the same basic idea.&#x201d; <br><br> Krick&#x2019;s theory of stock-market cycles had begun as an innocent intellectual recreation, or so he said, but in years to come he successfully played the markets using his system. The Wall Street Crash was no acci�dent, he maintained. It was a necessary piece of information within a larger story. Ryman, who had none of Krick&#x2019;s hucksterism, would have agreed. There are no accidents. Every so-called &#x201c;accident,&#x201d; every piece of turbulence, is part of a sequence, bigger or smaller, whose scale you can�not see. At least, you don&#x2019;t see it until it&#x2019;s too late, and then you start to panic, because you realise how foolish was your original fantasy of understanding. <br><br> During the Depression Krick sold pianos and worked as a jobbing concert pianist for the NBC Orchestra. He was also a radio disc jockey for a while. Eventually he found his way back to university, studying meteorology under Theodore von K�rm�n and Robert Millikan at Cal�tech in Los Angeles. It was uncanny to hear about these giants of mete�orology in a Glasgow hotel&#x2014;stranger still to do so with a glass of whisky in one hand and a busted flush in the other. <br><br> As the talk flowed, I drank more and more. I won a couple of pots. So did Krick, leaning his big face forward as he collected. The other Americans won one apiece. As the cards were dealt and shuffled and stacked, the smoke from our cigarettes and cigars swirled up the oak panelling, with its pictures of sporting scenes and moody Highland cat�tle. How well I would come to know their glowering stares. <br><br> Krick told more anecdotes as we played. &#x201c;Goering tried to lure back von K�rm�n to Europe to head up the Luftwaffe&#x2019;s weather forecasting,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Von K�rm�n refused, simply sending Goering a drawing of his Jewish profile.&#x201d; We all laughed. It was a meteorologists&#x2019; joke, a &#x201c;profile&#x201d; being a technical term in weather forecasting. <br> <br>As Krick talked I slowly began to realise the anecdotes were diver�sion tactics. The tales were intended to distract his opponents from their game&#x2014;and it was working. All the time he was recounting his experiences, or expounding pet theories, he was taking money off us. <br><br> The diverting stories continued. The duo had met at Caltech. Then Krick had joined an airline, as had Holzman, who became chief meteo�rologist for American Airlines. They began swapping tales about the aviation industry. <br> <br>&#x201c;I used to get in trouble in that first job,&#x201d; Krick drawled, showing another hand. A pair of deuces&#x2014;plus another pair of deuces. Four of a kind against my full house, and there he was scooping up our money again.&#x201c;They hadn&#x2019;t heard of weather fronts then,and hated me drawing them on the charts. But obviously it was more useful for the pilots. Then they could see where the action was coming from. Predictable as a corny movie.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;Irv worked in Hollywood,&#x201d; chipped in Holzman. &#x201c;He was weather prophet for <i>Gone with the Wind</i>.&#x201d; <br><br> Krick grinned as he added our money to his stack. &#x201c;I picked the night they burnt Atlanta. It had to be a clear one.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;Another time, he advised Bogart on the weather for the Ensenada yacht race,&#x201d; said Holzman. <br><br> &#x201c;I flubbed that. Bogie never got to Mexico. He stayed in U.S. waters. A dead calm.&#x201d; <br><br> Holzman laughed. &#x201c;Will you go back to it, Irv, when the war&#x2019;s over?&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;I doubt it. I was forecasting for the citrus industry before I got called up. Reckon I&#x2019;ll get back into it. That&#x2019;s where the money is.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;Commercial forecasting,&#x201d; nodded Holzman. <br><br> &#x201c;Transporting airplanes is another good one,&#x201d; added Krick. &#x201c;Forty planes going from A to B, you don&#x2019;t wanna get that wrong. One of my first duties in the air force in this war was to pick the days when our guys could fly safely across the Atlantic.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;Days with minimum turbulence?&#x201d; I asked. <br><br> &#x201c;Oh no,&#x201d; said Krick. &#x201c;Pick those days and our friends in the Luft�waffe would be waiting. It was more a case of just enough turbulence.&#x201d; He produced a cigar from under the table and, as prelude to another tale, blew a near-perfect smoke ring over my head . . . <br><br> It has always struck me as <i>fate </i>that I met those two at the beginning of my working life. From my Cambridge ivory tower I have followed their careers with interest since the war, now and then bumping into one or the other of them on trips to America. They became sort of alter egos for me, standing for all the possibilities I shut off when I chose withdrawal into academic life. <br> <br>Later in the war Holzman would work on the weather forecast for the atom bomb at Los Alamos. He stayed in the U.S. Air Force for his entire career, becoming a general and commander of the USAAF Research Laboratory. He was involved in virtually every major phase of research into missile and space systems, all through the Cold War. His security clearance was cosmic, so I didn&#x2019;t get to see him much. <br><br> Krick, as he indicated during that poker session, would pretty much found the new industry of selling the weather. Cotton growers wanting to know what the harvest will be like. The Edison Company having dif�ficulties with storms knocking out power lines. The California Division of Highways worrying about snow in the mountains. The Brooklyn Dodgers wanting advice on whether they should buy rain insurance for an important game. Loggers, fruit growers, the managers of hydroelec�tric schemes... <br> <br>Krick pursued all this and more. He was weather forecaster for the 1960 Winter Olympics and, the following year, for the inauguration of President Kennedy. But his biggest thing was cloud-seeding, which involved modifying weather by dispersing chemicals, usually silver iodide, or dry ice, into clouds to induce precipitation. <br><br> Krick got into this still-controversial practice in a major way, selling thousands of ground-based generators to farmers all over the U.S. These machines, rocketing crystals into the reluctant sky, were all con�trolled by radio from a complex in Palm Springs, California, where Krick himself still lives in a Moorish-style mansion in the shadow of Mount San Jacinto. <br><br> I went to visit him there once&#x2014;the place had marble floors&#x2014;and he was extremely hospitable, serving up frozen margaritas. But to the U.S. Weather Bureau he became a kind of b�te noire. There were accusations of quackery and exploitation. He was always very charming to me, and I never brought up something which troubled my colleagues: that he may have been the source of the rumours, still current to this day in the U.S., that the British teams &#x201c;failed&#x201d; in their predictions for Overlord&#x2014; and that D-Day was saved by Krick himself.

Now, in The Honourable Schoolboy, George Smiley -- who has assumed the unenviable job of restoring the health, and reputation, of his demoralized organisation -- goes over to the attack. Salvaging what he can of the Service's ravaged network of spies, summoning back a few trustworthy old colleagues, working them -- and himself-around the clock, he searches for a whisper, a hint, a clue that will lead him back to his opposite number: Karla, the Soviet officer in Moscow Centre who masterminded the infamous treachery.<br><br>When he finds his opening, Smiley moves without hesitation. His battleground: the Far East. His choice of weapons: the Honourable Gerald (Jerry) Westerby, an Old Asia Hand, veteran of several marriages (and wars), unquestioning in his readiness to answer Smiley's summons. "You point me and I'll march," says Jerry.<br><br>Jerry's odyssey begins: to Hong Kong-and blackmail and murder; to collapsing Cambodia and Vietnam-and drug traffickers, the CIA, and a huge and mystifying "gold seam" spilling out of Russia. Slowly, manipulated by Smiley and his cohorts back in the Circus, Jerry thrusts himself into the centre of an intrigue of money, defection, passion -- and finds not only fertile ground for Smiley's revenge, but a drama of loyalty and love that both tests his courage and spurs his belated coming of age, in tragic defiance of the voracious requirements of the trice which owns his allegiance.<br><br>Here is John le Carre's richest, most accomplished work. Suspense, excitement, the techniques of espionage as only he has been able to make them real for us -- together with a Towing capacity for sustained action, a grandly conceived and intricately drawn plot, and profound observation of the Far Eastern landscape.

The letters in this volume, written between 1940, when Kerouac was a freshman at college, and 1956, immediately before his breathless leap into celebrity with the publication of <b>On the Road</b>, offer invaluable insights into Kerouac's family life, his friendships with Neal and Carolyn Cassady, Allen Ginsberg, Gary Snyder, and William S. Burroughs, his travels, love affairs, and literary apprenticeship. At once fascinating reading and a major addition to Kerouac scholarship, here is a rare portrait of the writer as a young adventurer of immense talent, energy, and ambition in the midst of writing and living an American legend.</p><p>Jack Kerouac is one of America's most influential literary figures. <i>On the Road</i> begot the Beat Generation, which ushered in the hippie movement, then free love, then drugs and so on and so on. Yet the real Kerouac bore little resemblance to this enduring image as an open-road rebel and spokesman of the Beats. He was a lover of women and wine, all right, but also a sad, confused romantic who longed for acceptance and often viewed life with a child's perspective. By capturing his emotions in his personal writings, <i>Selected Letters</i> helps shed light on a figure who was as troubled as he was rebellious.Jack Kerouac(1922-1969), the central figure of the Beat Generation, was born in Lowell, Massachusetts, in 1922 and died in St. Petersburg, Florida, in 1969. Among his many novels are <b>On the Road</b>, <b>The Dharma Bums</b>, <b>Big Sur</b>, and <b>Visions of Cody</b>.<br>Ann Charters is the editor of <b>The Portable Sixties Reader</b>, <b>The Portable Jack Kerouac</b>, two volumes of Jack Kerouac's <b>Selected Letters</b>, and <b>Beat Down to Your Soul</b>.

He also edited Vasari&#x2019;s Florence: Artists and Literati at the Medicean Court.Preface to the Lives<br><br> I have no manner of doubt that it is with almost all writers a common and deeply-fixed opinion that sculpture and painting together were first discovered, by the light of nature, by the people of Egypt, and that there are certain others who attribute to the Chald�ans the first rough sketches in marble and the first reliefs in statuary, even as they also give to the Greeks the invention of the brush and of coloring. But I will surely say that of both one and the other of these arts the design, which is their foundation, nay rather, the very soul that conceives and nourishes within itself all the parts of man&#x2019;s intellect, was already most perfect before the creation of all other things, when the Almighty God, having made the great body of the world and having adorned the heavens with their exceeding bright lights, descended lower with His intellect into the clearness of the air and the solidity of the earth, and, shaping man, discovered, together with the lovely creation of all things, the first form of sculpture; from which man afterwards, step by step (and this may not be denied), as from a true pattern, there were taken statues, sculptures, and the science of pose and of outline; and for the first pictures (whatsoever they were), softness, harmony, and the concord in discord that comes from light and shade. Thus, then, the first model whence there issued the first image of man was a lump of clay, and not without reason, seeing that the Divine Architect of time and of nature, being Himself most perfect, wished to show in the imperfection of the material the way to add and to take away; in the same manner wherein the good sculptors and painters are wont to work, who, adding and taking away in their models, bring their imperfect sketches to that final perfection which they desire. He gave to man that most vivid color of flesh, whence afterwards there were drawn for painting, from the mines of the earth, the colors themselves for the counterfeiting of all those things that are required for pictures. It is true, indeed, that it cannot be affirmed for certain what was made by the men before the Flood in these arts in imitation of so beautiful a work, although it is reasonable to believe that they too carved and painted in every manner; seeing that Belus, son of the proud Nimrod, about 200 years after the Flood, caused to be made that statue wherefrom there was afterwards born idolatry, and his son&#x2019;s wife, the very famous Semiramis, Queen of Babylon, in the building of that city, placed among its adornments not only diverse varied kinds of animals, portrayed and colored from nature, but also the image of herself and of Ninus, her husband, and, moreover, statues in bronze of her husband&#x2019;s father, of her husband&#x2019;s mother, and of the mother of the lat- ter, as Diodorus relates, calling them by the Greek names (that did not yet exist) Jove, Juno, and Ops. From these statues, perchance, the Chald�ans learned to make the images of their gods, seeing that 150 years later Rachel, in flying from Mesopotamia together with Jacob her husband, stole the idols of Laban her father, as is clearly related in Genesis. Nor, indeed, were the Chald�ans alone in making sculptures and pictures, but the Egyptians made them also, exercising themselves in these arts with that so great zeal which is shown in the marvelous tomb of the most ancient King Osimandyas, copiously described by Diodorus, and proved by the stern commandment made by Moses in the Exodus from Egypt, namely, that under pain of death there should be made to God no image whatsoever. He, on descending from the mountain, having found the golden calf wrought and adored solemnly by his people, and being greatly perturbed to see Divine honors paid to the image of a beast, not only broke it and reduced it to powder, but for punishment of so great a sin caused many thousands of the wicked sons of Israel to be slain by the Levites. But because not the making of statues but their adoration was a deadly sin, we read in Exodus that the art of design and of statuary, not only in marble but in every kind of metal, was bestowed by the mouth of God on Bezaleel, of the tribe of Judah, and on Aholiab, of the tribe of Dan, who were those that made the two cherubim of gold, the candlesticks, the veil, the borders of the priestly vestments, and so many other most beautiful castings for the Tabernacle, for no other reason than to bring the people to contemplate and to adore them.<br><br> From the things seen before the Flood, then, the pride of men found the way to make the statues of those for whom they wished that they should remain famous and immortal in the world. And the Greeks, who think differently about this origin, say that the Ethiopians invented the first statues, as Diodorus tells; that the Egyptians took them from the Ethiopians, and, from them, the Greeks; for by Homer&#x2019;s time sculpture and painting are seen to have been perfected, as it is proved, in discoursing of the shield of Achilles, by that divine poet, who shows it to us carved and painted, rather than described, with every form of art. Lactantius Firmianus, by way of fable, attributes it to Prometheus, who, in the manner of Almighty God, shaped man&#x2019;s image out of mud; and from him, he declares, the art of statuary came. But according to what Pliny writes, this came to Egypt from Gyges the Lydian, who, being by the fire and gazing at his own shadow, suddenly, with some charcoal in his hand, drew his own outline on the wall. And from that age, for a time, outlines only were wont to be used, with no body of color, as the same Pliny confirms; which method was rediscovered with more labor by Philocles the Egyptian, and likewise by Cleanthes and Ardices of Corinth and by Telephanes of Sicyon.<br><br> Cleophantes of Corinth was the first among the Greeks who used colors, and Apollodorus the first who discovered the brush. There followed Polygnotus of Thasos, Zeuxis, and Timagoras of Chalcis, with Pythias and Aglaophon, all most celebrated; and after these the most famous Apelles, so much esteemed and honored by Alexander the Great for his talent, and the most ingenious investigator of slander and false favor, as Lucian shows us; even as almost all the excellent painters and sculptors were endowed by Heaven, in nearly every case, not only with the adornment of poetry, as may be read of Pacuvius, but with philosophy besides, as may be seen in Metrodorus, who, being as well versed in philosophy as in painting, was sent by the Athenians to Paulus Emilius to adorn his triumph, and remained with him to read philosophy to his sons.<br><br> The art of sculpture, then, was greatly exercised in Greece, and there appeared many excellent craftsmen, and, among others, Pheidias, an Athenian, with Praxiteles and Polycletus, all very great masters, while Lysippus and Pyrgoteles were excellent in sunk reliefs, and Pygmalion in reliefs in ivory, of whom there is a fable that by his prayers he obtained breath and spirit for the figure of a virgin that he made. Painting, likewise, was honored and rewarded by the ancient Greeks and Romans, seeing that to those who made it appear marvelous they showed favor by bestowing on them citizenship and the highest dignities. So greatly did this art flourish in Rome that Fabius gave renown to his house by writing his name under the things so beautifully painted by him in the temple of Salus, and calling himself Fabius Pictor. It was forbidden by public decree that slaves should exercise this art throughout the cities, and so much honor did the nations pay without ceasing to the art and to the craftsmen that the rarest works were sent among the triumphal spoils, as marvelous things, to Rome, and the finest craftsmen were freed from slavery and recompensed with honors and rewards by the commonwealths.<br><br> The Romans themselves bore so great reverence for these arts that besides the respect that Marcellus, in sacking the city of Syracuse, commanded to be paid to a craftsman famous in them, in planning the assault of the aforesaid city they took care not to set fire to that quarter wherein there was a most beautiful painted panel, which was afterwards carried to Rome in the triumph, with much pomp. Thither, having, so to speak, despoiled the world, in course of time they assembled the craftsmen themselves as well as their finest works, wherewith afterwards Rome became so beautiful, for the reason that she gained so great adornment from the statues from abroad more than from her own native ones; it being known that in Rhodes, the city of an island in no way large, there were more than 30,000 statues counted, either in bronze or in marble, nor did the Athenians have less, while those at Olympia and at Delphi were many more and those in Corinth numberless, and all were most beautiful and of the greatest value. Is it not known that Nicomedes, King of Lycia, in his eagerness for a Venus that was by the hand of Praxiteles, spent on it almost all the wealth of his people? Did not Attalus the same, who, in order to possess the picture of Bacchus painted by Aristides, did not scruple to spend on it more than 6,000 sesterces? Which picture was placed by Lucius Mummius in the temple of Ceres with the greatest pomp, in order to adorn Rome.<br><br> But for all that the nobility of these arts was so highly valued, it is none the less not yet known for certain who gave them their first beginning. For, as has been already said above, it appears most ancient among the Chald�ans, some give it to the Ethiopians, and the Greeks attribute it to themselves; and it may be thought, not without reason, that it is perchance even more ancient among the Etruscans, as our Leon Batista Alberti testifies, whereof we have clear enough proof in the marvelous tomb of Porsena at Chiusi, where, no long time since, there were discovered underground, between the walls of the Labyrinth, some terra-cotta tiles with figures on them in half-relief, so excellent and in so beautiful a manner that it can be easily recognized that the art was not begun precisely at that time, nay rather, by reason of the perfection of these works, that it was much nearer its height than its beginning. To this, moreover, witness is likewise borne by our seeing every day many pieces of those red and black vases of Arezzo, made, as may be judged from the manner, about those times, with the most delicate carvings and small figures and scenes in low-relief, and many small round masks wrought with great subtlety by masters of that age, men most experienced, as is shown by the effect, and most excellent in that art. It may be seen, moreover, by reason of the statues found at Viterbo at the beginning of the pontificate of Alexander VI, that sculpture was in great esteem and in no small perfection among the Etruscans; and although it is not known precisely at what time they were made, it may be reasonably conjectured, both from the manner of the figures and from the style of the tombs and of the buildings, no less than from the inscriptions in those Etruscan letters, that they are most ancient and were made at a time when the affairs of this country were in a good and prosperous state. But what clearer proof of this can be sought? seeing that in our own day&#x2014;that is, in the year 1554&#x2014;there has been found a bronze figure of the Chim�ra of Bellerophon, in making the ditches, fortifications, and walls of Arezzo, from which figure it is recognized that the perfection of that art existed in ancient times among the Etruscans, as may be seen from the Etruscan manner and still more from the letters carved on a paw, about which&#x2014;since they are but few and there is no one now who understands the Etruscan tongue&#x2014;it is conjectured that they may represent the name of the master as well as that of the figure itself, and perchance also the date, according to the use of those times. This figure, by reason of its beauty and antiquity, has been placed in our day by the Lord Duke Cosimo in the hall of the new rooms in his Palace, wherein there have been painted by me the acts of Pope Leo X. And besides this there were found in the same place many small figures in bronze after the same manner, which are in the hands of the said Lord Duke.<br><br> But since the dates of the works of the Greeks, the Ethiopians, and the Chald�ans are as doubtful as our own, and perhaps more, and by reason of the greater need of founding our judgment about these works on conjectures, which, however, are not so feeble that they are in every way wide of the mark, I believe that I strayed not at all from the truth (and I think that everyone who will consent to consider this question discreetly will judge as I did), when I said above that the origin of these arts was nature herself, and the example or model, the most beautiful fabric of the world, and the master, that divine light infused by special grace into us, which has not only made us superior to the other animals, but, if it be not sin to say it, like to God. And if in our own times it has been seen (as I trust to be able to demonstrate a little later by many examples) that simple children roughly reared in the woods, with their only model in the beautiful pictures and sculptures of nature, and by the vivacity of their wit, have begun by themselves to make designs, how much more may we, nay, must we confidently believe that these primitive men, who, in proportion as they were less distant from their origin and divine creation, were thereby the more perfect and of better intelligence, that they, by themselves, having for guide nature, for master purest intellect, and for exam- ple the so lovely model of the world, gave birth to these most noble arts, and from a small beginning, little by little bettering them, brought them at last to perfection? I do not, indeed, wish to deny that there was one among them who was the first to begin, seeing that I know very well that it must needs be that at some time and from some one man there came the beginning; nor, also, will I deny that it may have been possible that one helped another and taught and opened the way to design, to color, and relief, because I know that our art is all imitation, of nature for the most part, and then, because a man cannot by himself rise so high, of those works that are executed by those whom he judges to be better masters than himself. But I say surely that the wishing to affirm dogmatically who this man or these men were is a thing very perilous to judge, and perchance little necessary to know, provided that we see the true root and origin wherefrom art was born. For since, of the works that are the life and the glory of the craftsmen, the first and step by step the second and the third were lost by reason of time, that consumes all things, and since, for lack of writers at that time, they could not, at least in that way, become known to posterity, their craftsmen as well came to be forgotten. But when once the writers began to make record of things that were before their day, they could not speak of those whereof they had not been able to have information, in a manner that there came to be first with them those of whom the memory had been the last to be lost. Even as the first of the poets, by common consent, is said to be Homer, not because there were none before him, for there were, although not so excellent, which is seen clearly from his own works, but because of these early poets, whatever manner of men they were, all knowledge had been lost quite 2,000 years before. However, leaving behind us this part, as too uncertain by reason of its antiquity, let us come to the clearer matters of their perfection, ruin, and restoration, or rather resurrection, whereof we will be able to discourse on much better grounds.<br><br> I say, then, it being true indeed, that they began late in Rome, if the first figure was, as is said, the image of Ceres made of met...</p><h2>Death and the Oxford Box: A Mystery Introducing Kate Ivory</h2><p>A member of the Fridesley Runners, a jogging club, Veronica Stallwood finds herself getting in over her head with a fellow runner when she agrees to help the woman repossess some family heirlooms the woman&#39;s estranged husband has appropriated.</p><p>Inoffensive Rose Smith has a problem: her estranged husband Theo has kept half the collection of memento mori enamel boxes that her well-heeled aunt gave them as a wedding present--and that she now expects to see on her next visit. So the Fridesley Runners of Oxford, who jog with Rose, offer to break into Theo's place and take the boxes while a workout tape gives them all an alibi. But one of the Runners takes advantage of the alibi to kill dentist Yvonne Baight, who's been keeping plenty of people besides her lumpish daughter Sophie under her thumb by blackmailing them into supporting her stand against her former lover, developer Tom Grant--and it's up to reluctant historical novelist Kate Ivory to turn a gimlet eye on her fellow Runners. Despite a nice eye for the absurdity of suburban rituals, Stallwood (Deathspell, 1992) leans a little too hard on repeated doses of those old standbys--blackmail and adultery; her sketchy characters barely cast shadows. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Kate Ivory is a British writer in Oxford and a member of a jogging group, all of whom rally around fellow runner, the recently abandoned Rose. Rose's nasty husband has left her and taken half of a collection of enamel boxes given them by her slightly dotty grandmother. Now Rose is in a panic because Grandma has announced a visit to discuss the sale of the valuable 19th-century pieces, especially the Oxford mourning box, which the husband won't return. The group devises a plan to steal the boxes back, but while that is in motion, one of the runners is murdered. And the Oxford box is nowhere to be found. Kate suspects that events may be connected when she learns that the missing enamel box was last seen in the home of the murder victim, who was involved in a local land deal. Tangled in plot and with a casual attitude toward crime that belies its mainly cozy-ish, suburban atmosphere, the tale from the author of Deathspell also lacks an engaging cast. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Falcon on the Wind</h2><p>This book is coming soon in a new, revised Author's Preferred Edition as a Kindle ebook and in paperback here on Amazon.

Discusses the reckless annihilation of fish and birds by the use of pesticides, and warns of the possible genetic effects on humans.</p><p><i>Silent Spring</i>, released in 1962, offered the first shattering look at widespread ecological degradation and touched off an environmental awareness that still exists. Rachel Carson's book focused on the poisons from insecticides, weed killers, and other common products as well as the use of sprays in agriculture, a practice that led to dangerous chemicals to the food source. Carson argued that those chemicals were more dangerous than radiation and that for the first time in history, humans were exposed to chemicals that stayed in their systems from birth to death. Presented with thorough documentation, the book opened more than a few eyes about the dangers of the modern world and stands today as a landmark work.Rachel Carson (1907&#x2013;1964) spent most of her professional life as a marine biologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. By the late 1950s, she had written three lyrical, popular books about the sea, including the best-selling The Sea Around Us, and had become the most respected science writer in America. She completed Silent Spring against formidable personal odds, and with it shaped a powerful social movement that has altered the course of history.</p><h2>The Black House</h2><p>A collection of eleven macabre stories including &#34;Blow It,&#34; about a New York accountant who learns a valuable lesson when he tries to romance two women, and the title story, about a house haunted by some unusual ghosts</p><p>Patricia Highsmith was born in Fort Worth, Texas, in 1921.

It has an unpretentious verbal immediacy thanks to its spoken origin and is written in the key of Aplogetic Mumble: "Those who dislike Dickens have an excellent case. He ought to be bad." Such gentle provocations litter these pages. How can you not read on? Forster's critical writing is so ridiculously plainspoken, so happily commonsensical, that we often forget to be intimidated by the rhetorical landscapes he so ably leads us through. As he himself points out in the introductory note, "Since the novel is itself often colloquial it may possibly withhold some of its secrets from the graver and grander streams of criticism, and may reveal them to backwaters and shallows."</p><p> And Forster does paddle into some unlikely eddies here. For instance, he seems none too gung ho about love in the novel: "And lastly, love. I am using this celebrated word in its widest and dullest sense. Let me be very dry and brief about sex in the first place." He really means in the first place. Like the narrator of a '50s hygiene film, Forster continues, dry and brief as anything, "Some years after a human being is born, certain changes occur in it..." One feels here the same-sexer having the last laugh, heartily.</p><p> Forster's brand of humanism has fallen from fashion in literary studies, yet it endures in fiction itself. Readers still love this author, even if they come to him by way of the multiplex. The durability of his work is, of course, the greatest raison d'�tre this book could have.

Now in his late fifties, he has clocked up many thousands of hours of reflection. It shows in his prose, which proceeds at a refreshingly deliberative pace as it draws the reader into his patterns and rhythms. </p><p>In this deeply appealing and engaging collection of essays, Birkerts looks back through his own life, as well as at the generations before him, and ahead at the lives of his children. We read how the writer witnesses his son's frightening sailing accident, how he feels when he encounters his own prose from many years ago, how finding a cigarette lighter or a lost ring releases a cascade of memories. The objects he sees around him&#x2015;old friends, remembered places&#x2015;are excavated, their layers exposed. </p><p>But most winning of all is the emerging character of Birkerts himself. We come to have great respect for this competitive but deeply loyal friend, the caring father who respects his children's independence even as he tries to connect with them, the traveler, the onetime bookseller, the writer at all stages of his writing life, and throughout it all, the attentive, passionate reader.</p></p><p><p><b>Sven Birkerts</b> is the author of eight books, including <i>The Art of Time in Memoir</i>, <i>Reading Life</i>, <i>Readings</i>, and <i>The Gutenberg Elegies</i>. He has taught at Harvard University and currently directs the Bennington Writing Seminars and is the editor of <i>AGNI</i>. He lives in Massachusetts.</p><p>&#x201c;More than revealing the insights he obtains through contemplation, Birkerts sheds light on the process of allowing connections to fuel ruminations that lead to a greater understanding of self. Readers will delight in the humor and insights conveyed in these enchanting and well-crafted essays.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly, starred review</i></p><p>&#x201c;Like a modern-day Proust, though at blessedly shorter length, Birkerts's keen eye and sinuous prose are triggered time and again by the humblest of objects. . . . [<i>The Other Walk</i>] should be picked up, reread and savored for its expressive beauty and its gentle reminder that we can find life's fullness amid its most inconsequential moments.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Shelf Awareness</i></p><p>&#x201c;One of America's finest literary critics brings us 45 short autobiographical pieces meditating on the necessity and delight of quiet contemplation in a busy existence. . . . Sven Birkerts's thoughtful and elegant <i>pens�es</i> reveal the enchantment awaiting anyone who slows down long enough to look.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Barnes &amp; Noble Review</i></p><p>&#x201c;Birkerts' essays, many of them about fatherhood, some about his Latvian heritage, are full of the passage of time--nostalgia, regret, melancholy. . . . In each essay, he looks for 'the prompt, the sliver, the bit of grit that grows the pearl.' He looks for the 'smallest detail in the heart of the day.'&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Newsday</i></p><p>&#x201c;[Birkerts] is one of the foremost essayists working today. He doesn't care about seeming cool or sounding smart; he writes what he thinks. In this new gathering, he combines his typically astute literary criticism with personal essays about his first post-college job at Borders Books in Ann Arbor, Michigan; the night he learned to play chess; and his reflections on Saul Bellow.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Chicago Tribune</i></p><p>&#x201c;In his latest collection of [essays], Birkerts remains astute, witty and surprisingly sentimental. . . . It's impossible to read these close-to-the-ground essays without reminiscing on one's own past, connecting the dots between possessions and emotions, say, or reconciling memories of old lovers and friends with the way things turned out.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>&#x201c;Critic, memoirist, and all-around man of letters Birkerts is a virtuoso of the short essay. Each of the 45 concentrated, autobiographical meditations in this evocative volume offers a glimpse into the evolution of a writer's sensibility, both in the memories and the vignettes they preserve and in Birkerts' caressing of language and the pursuit of meaning. . . . Birkerts' poetic dispatches portray a life of fruitful steadfastness and inevitable change.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Booklist</i></p><p>&#x201c;Very much about making connections between the vast details of life, time becomes as central a character across these essays as Birkerts himself. His voice is one marked--for the better--by time. . . . This is not a voice of lamentation or complaint. [Birkerts] is honest and straightforward, at times humorous and at others surprisingly sentimental, but always unapologetic.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Ploughshares</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>The Other Walk</i> comprises 45 short pieces . . . and with each, Birkerts considers his route with a keen eye, wit, and spare, elegant prose. . . . He succeeds in guiding us into his head, allows us to take his measure, then leaves us feeling as if we have traveled somewhere new.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>NewPages</i></p><p>&#x201c;Birkerts doesn't overwhelm with nostalgia but invites us into that part of his past to observe and slowly begin to understand our author and the events that have shaped him. . . .

His no-holds-barred practice habits and fondness for after-hours merriment moved his first NFL bosses with the New England Patriots to label him part of &#34;the criminal element&#34; in the league before they waived him prior to his second season. He was a much better fit for a Bears team that was still under the watchful gaze of its tough-as-nails founder, George Halas, and in the process of developing its revolutionary &#34;46&#34; defense under Buddy Ryan. McMichael was witness to the last days of Neill Armstrong&#39;s ill-fated coaching regime, all of Mike Ditka&#39;s tempestuous tenure, and Dave Wannstedt&#39;s rookie season in charge. He covers it all, from training camp misadventures in Lake Forest, Illinois, and Platteville, Wisconsin and Ditka&#39;s locker room tirades to nights on the town with Dan Hampton and friends and behind-the-scenes glimpses of extraordinary teammates, including Hall of Famers Hampton, Walter Payton, and Mike Singletary. McMichael relives his week in New Orleans--the perfect party town for the perfect party team--before the Bears won Super Bowl XX in dominating fashion. Steve McMichael&#39;s Tales from the Bears Sideline recounts the rivalries with Green Bay and San Francisco, the rise to stardom of William &#34;Refrigerator&#34; Perry, and the Grammy-nominated team video, the &#34;Super Bowl Shuffle,&#34; which McMichael loathed. He revisits all the reasons the team failed to win a couple more titles--from Jim McMahon vs. Doug Flutie to everybody vs. Michael McCaskey, the late Halas&#39;s Yale-educated grandson and successor. McMichael watchedtraining camp in Platteville become a carnival, literally, and watched the Bears at the end of his career from a most unexpected vantage point: through the facemask of a Green Bay Packers helmet.</p><p></p><h2>Billy Lynn&#39;s Long Halftime Walk: A Novel</h2><p><p><strong>New York Times Bestseller<br>Now a Major Motion Picture</strong><br><br><strong>&#x201c;Brilliantly done . . . grand, intimate, and joyous.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<em>New York Times Book Review</em></strong></p><p><strong>&#x201c;Mothers, fathers, sons, and daughters: read this giant-hearted novel.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;MARIA SEMPLE, author of <em>Where&#x2019;d You Go, Bernadette</em></strong></p><p>Three minutes and forty-three seconds of intensive warfare with Iraqi insurgents&#x2014;caught on tape by an embedded Fox News crew&#x2014;has transformed the eight surviving men of Bravo Squad into America&#x2019;s most sought-after heroes.

The mystery is all the more striking because the repeal was not done in the dead of night, like a congressional pay raise. It came at the end of a multiyear populist campaign launched by a few individuals, and was heralded by its supporters as a signal achievement for Americans who are committed to the work ethic and the American Dream.</p><br><p> Graetz and Shapiro conducted wide-ranging interviews with the relevant players: members of congress, senators, staffers from the key committees and the Bush White House, civil servants, think tank and interest group representatives, and many others. The result is a unique portrait of American politics as viewed through the lens of the death tax repeal saga. Graetz and Shapiro brilliantly illuminate the repeal campaign's many fascinating and unexpected turns--particularly the odd end result whereby the repeal is slated to self-destruct a decade after its passage. They show that the stakes in this fight are exceedingly high; the very survival of the long standing American consensus on progressive taxation is being threatened.</p><br><p> Graetz and Shapiro's rich narrative reads more like a political drama than a conventional work of scholarship. Yet every page is suffused by their intimate knowledge of the history of the tax code, the transformation of American conservatism over the past three decades, and the wider political implications of battles over tax policy.</p></p><p><p>"Here we are, in the midst of great affluence and a badly skewed distribution of income. Yet, somehow, efforts are well advanced to abolish the estate tax as a first step toward ending the century-old consensus on the idea of progressivity in taxation. Michael Graetz and Ian Shapiro tell in vivid detail the sad (at least to me) story of how that is happening."<b>--Paul Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve</b></p><p>"An immensely readable and illuminating look at the estate tax issue and its implications for future American tax policy."<b>--Bill Bradley, former United States Senator</b></p><p>"[A] compelling book--a story that should be read by everyone who wants to understand the new power players of the right and their next target: the income tax system itself. When two of America's best academics combine theory with shoe leather reporting, the results are splendid."<b>--David Gergen, Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University; former White House adviser to presidents Nixon, Ford, Reagan, and Clinton.</b></p><p>"It's not about taxes, stupid. It's about politics! The book for Democrats who really want to know What's the Matter With Kansas?"<b>--Sylvia Nasar, author of<i>A Beautiful Mind</i></b></p><p>"<i>Death By a Thousand Cuts</i> is a marvelous book. I think of it as sort of a<i>Moneyball</i> for politics, with the role of Billy Bean played by Grover Norquist. The story of how Norquist and company pulled one over on the Democrats (and perhaps centrists of all stripes) is a great read. The book is certain to become a bible for inside-the-beltway readers, but it should be read by a very wide audience. The book changed the way I think about the politics of the estate tax debate. In fact, the book has changed my views about the politics of a number of related issues."<b>--Joe Bankman, Stanford University School of Law</b></p><p>"How was the estate tax law overhauled? Why was the tax eliminated for those who die in 2010? Graetz and Shapiro tell the story with wit, verve, and insight. The authors avoid accounts that overvalue the role of rhetorical cleverness or individual greed. They show instead how repeal proponents, out to make their case, skillfully employed powerful narratives about moral principle. This brilliant book brings human drama to the arid domain of tax policy. It is essential reading for those who would influence future debates about progressive taxation and the American ideal of fair opportunity for all."<b>--Jeffrey Lehman, President, Cornell University</b></p><p>"This is a terrific book--llively, well written, and razor sharp. Shapiro and Graetz take us on a splendid tour of American politics: out to visit policy entrepreneurs far from the beltway, over to the Washington players at the Heritage Foundation, and deep into the system in the workings of the congressional conference committees. This book is an intelligent person's Showdown at Gucci Gulch--far broader in its canvas's, deeper in its analysis, but just as gripping in its eye for telling political detail."<b>--James Morone, author of <i>Hellfire Nation</i></b></p><b>Michael J.

The other two are probably phantoms.</i><br><br>Will Carruthers played the bass in Spacemen 3 and then Spiritulized, one of the bands which emerged from their ashes. In some ways his story is that of an everyman in your regular, dysfunctional band with a disposition towards psychedelic misadventures. But this is not your average tale of high jinks and debauchery. <i>Playing the Bass with Three Left Hands</i> chronicles a decade in the life of a man on a collision course with hard drugs, poverty, and Dionysian epiphanies. It's a window onto a world where the life of a musician is day-to-day and hand-to-mouth.

Whether your interest is nostalgic or historical, THE FIFTIES CHRONICLE will have abundant appeal.<br> Major political and social themes are tackled with considerable deftness, and are effectively placed in the context of a nation that entered the 50s as the planet s unchallenged political, economic, and cultural leader. Ready employment, good wages for white- and blue-collar work, and a flood of consumer goods sparked the rise of a new American middle class that enjoyed an unprecedented standard of living. <br> But as the new decade began, America found itself living with the reality of the Soviet Union s atomic capability, a ferociously anti-Communist Red Scare at home, and messy air and ground combat on the divided Korean Peninsula. Thank goodness for President Eisenhower-- Ike --a model of good humor and stability in uncertain times.<br> The nation s sense of ambivalence--high living on the one hand and a grim fear of nuclear annihilation on the other--is a fascinating shadow cast over many of this big book s 448 pages. For every suburban family man who was proud of his new Pontiac there was a black man who was blocked from the job he needed and deserved. For every uplifting book the likes of Norman Vincent Peale s The Power of Positive Thinking there was a lurid comic book that seemed to celebrate crime and mock traditional values. For every teenager who reveled in the wealth of new products created just for her, there was a housewife who stared at her washing machine and asked, Is this all there is?<br> Of course, for millions of Americans--many women included--the new status quo was just fine. This is a key aspect of the sunny, optimistic side of the 50s, which THE FIFTIES CHRONICLE amply represents with images of sock hops, roller derby, family barbecues, Cinerama and CinemaScope, Disneyland, the 57 Chevy, Mickey Mantle, the Mousketeers, and many other artifacts of the period. All this, plus movie and TV stills, fashion shots, home furnishings, book and magazine covers, hardcover and paperback books, tiki mugs and toys, home and urban architecture, fine art, Beat culture, and industrial design, from electric shavers to the fabulous 59 Cadillac. and a lot more.<br> An illustrated prologue describing the Depression and war years, and an epilogue focused on the 1960s, place America s mid-century decade into clear perspective.<br> Immensely readable, THE FIFTIES CHRONICLE will make for fascinating reading at home, and will be indispensable to school and university collections. --Publications International, Ltd.</p><h2>The Complete Asian Cookbook Series: Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodida, Laos &amp; Burma</h2><p>For generations The Complete Asian Cookbook has been the most well-respected and authentic cookbook on Asian food.

Nanna wuldnt bleive me. Ettie wuldnt bleive me. Auntie Mercy wuldn't bleive me. But I got one. Now theyv got to blieve me." What young Angelica Cottington "got" was...a fairy. And, you are holding the evidence in your hands! It really happened--a hoax perpetrated by two girls who claimed to have photographed actual "fairies"; among the people caught up in the popular hysteria were Arthur Conan Doyle (who fell for it) and Harry Houdini (who did not). Now, this remarkable parody, written by a former member of the Monty Python troupe, takes a sly look at what happened in a fashion that's riotously witty, visually extraordinary, and wildly original. In every respect, this "handwritten diary" captures the look of the age--though the fairies, it is true, do sometimes have a more malevolent aspect than one might expect...A fresh--and funny--take on the true story that inspired two movies.<br></p><p>Terry Jones is a writer, actor and director best known for his membership of the Monty Python team.

If you want shivers sent up your spine, then this book should do the trick. The inside information and stories that Kyemba relays is quite appalling. And the insight we are provided into a clearly deranged individual&#39;s mind is startling to say the least. This book is definitely not recommended for the faint of heart.

She speaks internationally on the subjects of her books. With vulnerable openness, restored joy, and a sense of humor, Carol helps people to discover the secret of maintaining an enduring faith in the middle of an imperfect world. She and her husband, Gene, live in Florida.</p><i>Starred Review.</i> Normal isn't a word that makes sense to Kent, a bestselling author and speaker whose only son murdered his wife's ex-husband in 1999 to protect his stepdaughters from suspected abuse. Kent's previous book, <i>When I Lay My Isaac Down</i>, powerfully recounted her family's dramatic and wrenching story of placing their son's life sentence and their shattered future dreams on God's altar as the biblical Abraham did with his son Isaac. Kent's latest writing continues this harrowing story of rebuilding life where no "normal" exists; where holidays and Sundays are spent in prison visitation lines, and where pleas for leniency go unheard. Kent and her spouse employ dynamic journal entries and soulful personal stories to recount the ongoing, sometimes debilitating, journey to hold fast to God's hope despite dismal circumstances. Kent's inner ache is transparent and her pain raw, yet she delves into trusting God when despair is overwhelming, relief is beyond reach, privacy is no option, and loss overpowers all other emotions. In the midst of the pain&#x2014;more in spite of it&#x2014;the Kents choose hope, every day, every hour. This is their message of triumph to all Christians who suffer yet continue to hold fast to God's promised provision. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

His novella Behold the Man won the Nebula Award. He is also the recipient of the World Fantasy Award and the British Fantasy Award, among others. He and his wife, Linda, live in Texas.In this engrossing sequel to The Dreamthief's Daughter (2001), Moorcock weaves history, myth and alternate realities into a seamless whole. In 1951, Oona, the Dreamthief's daughter, and her albino husband, Ulrik von Bek, are enjoying a much needed vacation in Nova Scotia when Indian warriors kidnap Ulrik and drag him into the sea. Oona's search for Ulrik leads her through a maelstrom and into an America nearly 1,000 years in the past. At the same time, Oona's father, the albino Elrik of Melnibon&#x201a;, who is soul bonded to Ulrik, faces disaster. In a desperate attempt to save himself, Elrik dreams himself into the same mythic past in search of the beings who forged his black sword. Ulrik, meanwhile, learns that he was not so much kidnapped as recruited to save the multiverse. The tale's power stems largely from the astounding lyricism of the author's prose, the only flaw being the sometimes stilted and overly expository dialogue about the nature of the multiverse. Yet without these explanations, the complexity and mechanics of Moorcock's creation would confuse many readers, particularly those new to the series. An epilogue promises another installment, which should make fans of well-written and highly original fantasy extremely happy.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Further Adventures of the Little Mouse Trapped in a Book</h2><p>A mouse trapped inside the pages of a book chews his way out to an ocean and sails away in a paper boat.</p><p></p><h2>Battle Cry</h2><p>The book tells the story of how this diverse group came together to form an effective team, as well as describing the battles they fought in, including the Battle of Guadalcanal, Tarawa and the Battle of Saipan.

Like fine wines, exquisite cheeses, or the best caviars, a good cigar is something to be savored and appreciated with unabashed self-indulgence. Learn everything you have to know about the size, texture, age, and taste of cigars produced in America, the Caribbean, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia. 200 cigar brands are itemized, described, analyzed, and assayed; 80 of them are photographed. The history of cigars is included, and a special section of profiles of famous cigar smokers--from Winston Churchill to Fidel Castro, from Groucho Marx to Lauren Hutton, from Jack Kennedy to Arnold Schwartzenegger--reveals their likes and dislikes.</p><p>We have witnessed a reemergence of cigar culture--everyone is doing it, in popular movies, TV, and in the many cigar-friendly clubs which have sprung up. <i>The International Connoisseur's Guide to Cigars</i> is an authoritative guide to fine cigars from around the world. If you don't know a Cuban from a Swisher Sweet, this book will end that confusion! Over 100 full color photographs, fascinating cigar facts, and amusing anecdotes make this a "smoking" book! <i>--Naomi Gesinger</i></p><h2>The Israeli Holocaust Against the Palestinians</h2><p>Announcing one of the most explosive indictments of the Zionist State ever published! Here is unprecedented documentation of the horrendous atrocities which the Israelis visit upon the Palestinians; the fact-packed answer to the delusions of Limbaugh, O'Reilly, Falwell, Franklin Graham, William Bennett, George Will, Hitchens, Hanson and the legion of other prominent mercenaries and lapdogs of The Lobby. <p>Compiled by two elite scholars with impeccable credentials -- Michael Hoffman, a former reporter for the New York bureau of the Associated Press, and Moshe Lieberman, a former Hebrew University researcher -- the authors combine their sleuthing skills and erudition to bring the reader an irrefutable dossier of Israeli war crimes in Palestine, profusely illustrated with harrowing photos of the death and destruction which the Zionist war machine has administered as collective punishment upon the entire Palestinian nation. </p><p>Nothing like this book has ever seen print! "The Israeli Holocaust Against the Palestinians" is one of the most explosive indictments of the Zionist state ever published, proving conclusively that the Israelis themselves are guilty of a holocaust. </p><p>If books can still make a difference--and we believe they can--then "The Israeli Holocaust Against the Palestinians" is a tsunami that will force a sea change in American perceptions of the Middle East crisis. </p><p>Hoffman and Lieberman make a devastating case for Israeli criminality, while analyzing with profound insight the ferocious Talmudic racism that fuels the Israeli identification of the Palestinian people as "Amalek," and targets them for the final solution of "total eradication." The authors argue that to pretend that Zionist atrocities have not been systematically perpetrated in Palestine as part of a coherent dogma of eliminationism, constitutes nothing less than "holocaust denial."</p></p><p>American official history and official media tend to report Israeli attacks on Palestinians usually only once, and then often sparingly, sometimes omitting key elements. But there is never any annual remembrance of Arab victims of particularly savage and indiscriminate Israeli attacks, such as the 20,000 civilians slaughtered by the Israeli air force in Beirut, Lebanon in 1982, on orders of Ariel Sharon, culminating in massive terror bombing of the city center in August of that year. Neither is the 1948 massacre at Deir Yassin remembered or the 1994 mass murder of forty Palestinian worshipers by Baruch Goldstein at a mosque in Hebron. All that Arab blood is mighty cheap as it washes down the memory hole of Western history and media; too cheap to recall, even as the recollection of Jewish victimhood has been some how accorded eternal status.</p><h2>Making Wood Bowls With a Router &amp; Scroll Saw</h2><p>These truly innovative techniques make it easy to create wood bowls with only a router and scroll saw.</p><p></p><h2>Michelin Green Guide Greece (Green Guide/Michelin)</h2><p>Make the most of your trip to Greece with a fully updated Green Guide.

The initial lodgment, the pursuit up the Rhone valley, and winter warfare in the Vosges are all highlighted, as are the German Nordwind offensive and the reduction of the Colmar Pocket. This volume links the U.S. Army&#39;s Mediterranean and northern European operational series and provides an important counterpoint for those works dealing with Eisenhower&#39;s two more well-know army groups commanded by Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery and Lt. General Omar Bradley. The opening section treats the Southern France Campaign as part of the Mediterranean Theater of Operations; a middle section covers the fighting in the Vosges; and the final section takes up the battle of Alsace. Joint operations are highlighted in the treatment of Anvil, perhaps the most successful amphibious operation during the war, while the problems of combined (multinational) command are discussed throughout. A full account of German plans, organization, and actions is included for perspective, and the operations of the First French Army, a major component of the American army group, are also treated in detail.</p><p></p><h2>The One and the Many in the Israelite Conception of God</h2><p>If the argument of this short study is sound, we have here a point of view which needs to be borne in mind as an aid to the solution of, not only textual and literary problems, but even more those problems which are associated with the attempt to employ such terms as &#39;polytheism&#39; and &#39;monotheism&#39; in connexion with Israelite thought, and also those which are inherent in the question of the prophetic psychology or, again, that of revelation. It may also be argued that along this line we gain a new approach to the New Testament extension of Jewish Monotheism in the direction of the later Trinitarianism. . . . At any rate, we can see how it was possible for a Jewish Christian to relate his Messiah so closely with the divine Being as to afford a basis for the later (and Greek) metaphysical formulation of the doctrine of the Trinity. -from the author&#39;s conclusions</p><p>Aubrey R.

One day later, her mother was killed right in front of her by an FBI sniper. She survived an eleven-day siege, hunkered down in a cabin on a mountain top in Naples, Idaho with her little sisters, her injured father, and injured adopted brother. But walking down that mountain to safety was only the beginning. In the years that followed, she was hounded by news media and reporters. People created their own versions of the event, each presenting their own spin, their own angle, and their own social or political views on those tragic days. But this book is Sara&#x2019;s story, written in her own words. It is the story of Ruby Ridge from the inside, from the perspective of the 16-year-old girl who experienced the nightmare firsthand. However, it isn&#x2019;t just about the pain and hopelessness that shadowed the next ten years as she tried to move on. Sara's story continues with the transformation in her heart that changed the course of her life. This book is about forgiving even the most horrible and personal of crimes. It&#x2019;s about finding hope, about finding joy and freedom from the only source that can offer it in this sometimes broken world&#x2014;her Savior, Jesus Christ.</p><p></p><h2>The Black Douglases: War and Lordship in Medieval Scotland 1300-1455</h2><p>During the century and a half of their power, the Black Douglases earned fame as Scotland&#39;s champions in the front line of the war against England. On their shields they bore the bloody heart of Robert the Bruce, the symbol of their claim to be the protectors of the hero-king&#39;s legacy. But others saw the power of these lords and earls of Douglas differently. To their critics, the clan was lawless, arrogant, and violent, their power resting on coercion and defiance--the Douglases spelled disorder in the kingdom. The Black Douglases examines aristocratic power and its place in Scottish political society through the greatest and most notorious magnate dynasty of late medieval Scotland. Emphasizing the link between warfare and political power, author Michael Brown analyzes the rise and fall of the family as the dominant magnates of the south, from the deeds of the Good Sir James Douglas in the service of Bruce to the violent destruction of the Douglas earls in the 1450&#39;s.</p><p></p><h2>Enormous Crocodile, The</h2><p>Fictional Novel, Children&#39;s Book</p><p>With his "secret plans and clever tricks," the Enormous Crocodile desires to lunch not with but <i>on</i> a nice, juicy child.

It is also being assigned in a number of college sex-ed courses, and one chain of sex stores requires new employees to read it as part of their training. The sellback rate among students is apparently quite low. (RJ from the University of Arizona cautions: "If you can find a used copy, thumb through it first for unusual stains or stuck pages.") <p>The Guide has now won three awards and has been translated into more than twelve languages. You won't find a sex book that has more heart and soul, and certainly not one that is a better value, or dare we say, bang for the buck.</p>The best way I know to thank people who have supported the Guide over the years is to make sure that each new edition reaches farther and takes more risks.

Hopefully, there's nothing mainstream or predictable about it. <p>Occasionally , I hear from people who expected the Guide to be like the cookie-cutter sexbooks that the big houses publish. Please understand that I never intended for the Guide to provide "the answers" or to tell you how to have sex. I just wanted it to help people think about sexual things in fun and intelligent ways. I wanted it be a 782-page excuse for people to share and explore their sexuality without it being too threatening or anxiety-provoking.

Fichte&#39;s 1804 Lectures On The Wissenschaftslehre (Suny Series in Contemporary Continental Philosophy)</h2><p><i>The first English translation of Fichte&#x2019;s second set of 1804 lectures on the Wissenschaftslehre.</i><br><br>Considered by some to be his most important text, this series of lectures given by Johann Gottlieb Fichte (1762&#x2013;1814) at his home in Berlin in 1804 is widely regarded as the most perspicuous presentation of his fundamental philosophy. Now available in English, this translation provides in striking and original language Fichte&#x2019;s exploration of the transcendental foundations of experience and knowing in ways that go beyond Kant and Reinhold and charts a promising, novel pathway for German Idealism. Through a close examination of this work one can see that Fichte&#x2019;s thought is much more than a way station between Kant and Hegel, thus making the case for Fichte&#x2019;s independent philosophical importance.<br><br>The text is divided into two parts: a doctrine of truth or reason, and a doctrine of appearance. A central feature of the text is its performative dimension. Philosophy, for Fichte, is something we enact rather than any discursively expressible object of awareness; a philosophical truth is not expressible as a set of propositions but is a spontaneous inwardly occurring realization. Therefore, he always regards the expression of philosophy in words as strategic, aiming to ignite philosophy&#x2019;s essentially inward process and to arouse the event of philosophical insight.<br><br>The new translation contains a German-English glossary and an extensive introduction and notes by the translator.</p><p><p>Walter E.

She holds a small book on her lap, one that she&#x2019;s made, and tells herself again the Bible stories it contains, the ones she has written anew, for herself, each story told aslant, from Jonah to Jesus, Moses to Mary Magdalen. Woven together and stitched by hand, they provide a new version, virtually a new translation, of the heart of this ancient and sacred text. Rakow's Bernadette traces, through each brief and familiar story, a line where belief and disbelief touch, the line that has been her home, ragged and neglected, that hidden seam.<br><br>The result is an amazing book of extraordinary beauty, so human and humorous, and yet so holy it becomes a work of poetry, a canticle, a song of lament and praise. In the private terrain of silence and devotion, shared with us by a writer of power and grace, Rakow offers, through Bernadette, her own lectio divina for the modern world.<br><br>No reader will forget this book or be able to read the Bible itself without a new perspective on this text that remains, arguably, Western civilization's greatest literary achievement.<br></p><p><b>Mary Rakow</b> is the recipient of two Lannan Foundation Residencies and a Lannan Foundation Literary Fellowship.<i>The Memory Room</i> was shortlisted for the Stanford University Libraries International Saroyan Prize in Literature, a PEN USA/West Finalist in Fiction and was listed among the Best Books of the West by<i>The Los Angeles Times</i>.

They aren't lifeless myths; they are mythic stories once again given flesh and blood" <i>Commonweal Magazine</i><br><br>"<i>This Is Why I Came</i> is a new mode of transportation. It elevates...unnerves and unsettles... And you finally arrive home, tenderly consoled. Glad tidings." Gregory Boyle, author of <i>Tattoos On The Heart</i><br><br> Examine the book thoroughly: it&#x2019;s miraculous.&#x201d; <i>Christian Century</i><br><br> But the reader starts to see a different kind of faith form, built on her revision of the testaments (particularly the Old, which is more vivid and startlingly rendered than the New). In Bernadette's Bible, man and God are both vulnerable to each other's disappointment, both culpable for their own mistakes. Whether God made man in his image or vice versa begins to seems moot. Either way, we're in the soup together.&#x201d; <i>Bookslut</i><br><br> Mary Rakow&#x2019;s quite extraordinary book is billed as a novel, but agnostic gospels&#x201d; would be more accurate labeling Rakow&#x2019;s feat in these fragments is to blend the gnomic and the prosaic, skepticism and wonder. At the close, the priest doesn&#x2019;t just absolve the woman of sin. To doubt the God you believe in is to serve him,&#x201d; he tells her. It&#x2019;s an offering. It&#x2019;s your gift.&#x201d; No faith is required to pay Rakow a similar tribute. Mere mortals can use imaginative jolts like the one she delivers.&#x201d; <i>The Atlantic</i><br><br> The outlines of the Bible stories are familiar, but their characters are more rounded, more poignant in Rakow&#x2019;s spare but poetic telling These tales, and the dozens others in this short book, are all ultimately human. If we are created in God&#x2019;s image, Rakow seems to say, then this deity must have the same failings we do. How we resolve them by reaching out to each other or, at the very least, like poor Cain, coming to a greater understanding of ourselves may be the true moral of all these tales.&#x201d; <i>The Boston Globe</i><br><br>"Rakow's latest novel brims with wildly imagined Bible stories, into which she infused new layers of mystery and mysticism, ambiguity and wonder. In her hands, tales we've heard all our lives achieve the miracle of surprise." <i>O Magazine</i><br><br>"[Rakow has] cast off her academic robe for this delicate work of fiction, which is informed by the most basic human desires and disappointments. ...the Old Testament chapters that open the book feel more imaginative, less constrained by fighting against theological dogma. Rakow moves unpredictably from the simple, stark details of the Sunday School versions we know to her own striking emendations and elaborations....brief as these prose poems are, they&#x2019;re still capable of arresting moments and startling insights ... the novel is tremendously poignant as it follows the life of Joseph, who speaks no words in the Gospels but finds his voice here." Ron Charles, <i>Washington Post</i><br><br> I did not think it was possible but Mary Rakow has made the greatest stories ever told&#x2019; even better.

Resistant to crystalline denouement and wary of firm answers, it beautifully bares the ragged edges of uncertainty. In cracking open ancient texts and considering them anew, Rakow insists on the value in still grappling with those ageless, unresolvable matters questions of where we came from, and why, and how we might be now that we are here." <i>Ploughshares</i><br><br>"There are some novels that are nearly impossible to describe, that eviscerate us with their power and resonance. Mary Rakow&#x2019;s, <i>This is Why I Came</i>, gathers ancient stories like worn and dried kindling, and ignites them with a blue incandescent light. The smoke catching in my lungs, my eyes wet and red. Yet I stayed to be warmed by this new, uttering transfixing reinvention of the stories of the Bible. Through the poetry of her phrases I stood breast to breast, hearts beating, breathing the same scented air as those who have been trapped within the pages. I felt unyielding love of the two Mary&#x2019;s, the vessel and the whore; the blood spattered on stone the humanity and divinity of a questioning, complex Jesus and his disciples, and so much more. Rakow has indeed created the Newest Testament. I will never look at Scripture in quite the same way." Cynthia Bond, author of <i>Ruby</i><br>"In a gorgeous melding of fable, theology, and poetry, Mary Rakow offers us versions of Bible stories that restore the gift of those stories' strangeness, which is to say their deep humanness. This disquieting, consoling novel is a book of questions, a book of doors: a companion for the long night of our unknowing." Garth Greenwell, author of <i>What Belongs to You</i><br><br> <i>This Is Why I Came</i> is a remarkable and remarkably unclassifiable book. Neither revisionist text, nor compendium of Bible tales made palatable to post-modern sensibilities, Rakow&#x2019;s scripture (what else can I call it?) is an entirely new creation. These holy narratives aren't summoned forward to meet us in our present time and place. Instead, it is us she coaxes back to the when of the events as they occur. &nbsp;And in this book, they do occur. There is no metaphor here. A miracle is exactly that. And miracles don't always end well. Mary Rakow has written through (and against and underneath and between) the stories we already know or think we know. &nbsp;Her cadence is incantatory. The wisdom, ancient. &nbsp;This is a book of great and dangerous grace.&#x201d; Jill Alexander Essbaum, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Hausfrau</i><br><br>"In these few exquisite pages, Rakow strips the skin of centuries from the central narratives of Western Culture, exposing the rawly human in all our grief and yearning. She portrays religion not as refuge, as gift, but as an arena of mistakes, passion and error, delusion--the profoundly disruptive encounter with God. An inflammatory, Blakean tour de force." Janet Fitch, author of <i>White Oleander</i> and <i>Paint it Black</i><br><br>"This lean volume filled my soul. Rapturously beautiful, tender, complex, Mary Rakow has written sentences and entire passages you need to read aloud to really hear the symphony of language. You can debate the message of This is Why I Came, but you must acknowledge its wisdom."<br>--Samantha Dunn, author of <i>Failing Paris</i> and <i>Not By Accident</i><br><br> Who would dare re-imagine the stories of the Bible? Mary Rakow, that&#x2019;s who. Author of a brilliant debut novel, The Memory Room, a Harvard Divinity School graduate gifted with the ear of a poet, Rakow&#x2019;s long awaited second novel, This is Why I Came is unusual, effortlessly lyrical and philosophically direct. The product of someone, rare in our time, who seems possessed of a biblical imagination. That the novel is controversial and culturally timely is clear, entering the current belief/disbelief debate in an intimate and original way. Yet the novel gifts us with far more than that. It is a ticket into a dream where the opaque feels transparent again, the shallow, profound and the presumed irrelevance of biblical characters, including God himself, is explored. In place of this rumor of our shared smallness, the transcendent quality of the world, of the ordinary, feels not only possible but logical, natural and true. As I read the last page, I was caught up in a trance where new meanings and understanding found a place to take flight." David Francis, author of <i>The Great Inland Sea</i>, <i>Stray Dog Winter</i> and <i>Wedding Bush Road</i><br><br>"We think we know the Bible. We think we know these old stories like we know our bodies. But Rakow explores the silences in these texts imagining realities yet undreamt. The startling result is her long-awaited second novel, <i>This is Why I Came</i>. Boldly and reverently she collapses time in her treatment of these biblical figures, grows forms and lifts the framework so that word becomes breath. She calls us to envision consciousness not enclosed in our heads or the spine of a book, even an ancient, and to many, a sacred book, but to celebrate it as alive, in constant interaction. This is what we look for in art. A vision that adds to the quality of our own consciousness, that breaks through reality as we know it. Our transfiguration.If all great art is praise, as she asserts, quoting Ruskin on her website, then <i>This is Why I Came</i> is praise of the most high. In the first chapter, she imagines Adam as the Maker, driven to despair because he cannot make the form he longs to see, the form that will tell him who he is. In this, Rakow succeeds where her Adam failed. Through her protagonist Bernadette, she has made a new form that tells us who we are. In her hands, words become cups of light and symbols are given their potential to reveal, again and anew, what it is to be human." Julianne Ortale, <i>Women on the Edge</i><br><br><b>Praise for <i>The Memory Room</i>:</b><br><br> Once you have read the last line and closed the cover, the world will not look quite the same. This is fiction as art, the page as canvas.&#x201d;<br> Sam Dunn, author of <i>Failing Paris</i> and <i>Not By Accident</i><br><br> In her suspenseful, poetic, mysterious and profound novel The Memory Room, Mary Rakow addresses the big questions how do we live with our knowledge of evil? And then what do we do with this knowledge, and how can we reconcile it with an equally profound awareness of the depth of the world&#x2019;s beauty and the possibility of faith? Approaching these fundamental issues not as a philosopher but as an artist using a subtle poet&#x2019;s touch, she explores the great paradoxes of the human condition without simplification or denial. The Memory Room marks the rarest of occurrences the debut of a literary master.&#x201d;<br> Janet Fitch, author of White Oleander and Paint It Black<br><br> Powerfully imagined and profoundly insightful.&#x201d;<br> <i>Kirkus Review</i><br><br> When I became aware that this book would be threading Paul Celan&#x2019;s words all throughout its own texture, I wondered if an American novel&#x2019;s contemporary language and concerns could sustain those of a tragic, brilliant Holocaust survivor. But I needn&#x2019;t have worried. Mary Rakow has seamlessly, subtly composed her own memory fugue, distant from Celan yet profoundly connected. It&#x2019;s at once intense and crystalline on every page.&#x201d;<br> John Felstiner, author of <i>Paul Celan, Poet, Survivor, Jew and Selected Poems</i> and <i>Prose of Paul Celan</i><br><br> Haunting and profound, The Memory Room refracts personal history and puts it back together as powerful art. Reading this utterly unique and very surprising novel, is like being awake 150 consecutive nights, watching, exquisite brushstroke by brushstroke, the painting of a mural depicting the navigation of a human soul through the transcendent severities of love, unspeakable loss, exhaustive and bold questioning of beauty and faith itself. Mary Rakow has written a daring, brilliant book.&#x201d;<br> Howard Norman, author of <i>The Museum Guard</i> and <i>The Haunting of L</i><br><br> It is the moral seriousness of Rakow&#x2019;s book, as much as the literary inventiveness, that elevates her work to the realm of literature.&#x201d;<br> Jonathan Kirsch, Art After Auschwitz&#x201d; <i>The Los Angeles Times</i>.<br><br> With subtlety, restraint and an extraordinary eye for detail, Rakow has constructed a breathtaking debut that avoids the clich�s of abuse narratives as it tests the boundaries of prose and poetry . Drawing from the Psalms and the poems of Paul Celan, Rakow has written a novel that distills the mysteries of suffering, faith and salvation into a complex yet accessible whole. The horror of her tale is ultimately redressed by the sensitivity and skill with which it is told.&#x201d;<br> <i>Publishers Weekly</i>, starred review</p><h2>Witch Hunt (Ophelia &amp; Abby Mysteries, No. 4)</h2><p><p>Small-town librarian Ophelia Jensen is finally starting to embrace her lot as one of the "chosen"&#x2014;a psychic and folk magick practitioner, a.k.a. a witch. Expert loving guidance from her magickally adept grandmother Abby helps&#x2014;and adopting Tink, an exceptionally talented teenage medium, has given Ophelia's life new purpose . . . until a brutal murder clouds the sunshine of their days. </p><p>Ophelia's co-worker and best friend, Darci, is distraught when her cousin is implicated in the small Iowa town of Summerset's most recent murder&#x2014;the violent death of a biker. Unfortunately for Darci's cousin, it's her fingerprints all over the murder weapon. She claims she's innocent, but it'll take Ophelia and Abby more than a good incantation or two to get to the bottom of this crime&#x2014;what with ghosts, crooked cops, secret identities, and a small army of outlaw bikers thrown into this devil's brew.</p></p><p><p>Shirley Damsgaard, author of numerous published short stories, resides with her family in small-town Iowa, where she has served as Postmaster for the last twenty years. She is currently working on the next Ophelia and Abby mystery, which again touches delightfully upon the paranormal.</p>Four installments into her paranormal mystery series (after <i>The Trouble with Witches</i>), Damsgaard delivers a scattershot whodunit that's more tedious than tricky. When her friend's cousin is charged with murdering a member of a motorcycle gang, librarian and returning heroine Ophelia Jensen reluctantly agrees to use her psychic gifts to help clear the woman. It's no easy case, however: the suspect, Becca, was found in bed with the dead man, her fingerprints all over the knife that killed him. A reading of the runes persuades Ophelia that the answers lie in the victim's past, and soon she's spinning theories and digging into an old crime that may have involved other gang members. At the same time, Ophelia has more personal concerns to deal with, including her foster daughter, budding medium Tink, and her own long-ignored abilities, which she's hoping to hone with the help of her gifted grandmother, Abby. Although the psychic elements are fresh and well handled, the heroine's habit of leaping to erroneous conclusions and brushing off obvious clues may frustrate mystery fans. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It describes modern leadership principles and techniques and illustrates them with stories from the author s vast life experiences. Leadership in the New Normal is intended for leaders and aspiring leaders in the fields of business, management, government, military, education, and other worthwhile forms of human endeavor. It is written by a leader who speaks from experience a family man, business consultant, active public speaker, an Army general (now retired) who burst upon the national scene when New Orleans was in dire straits following Hurricane Katrina. And in the course of doing his job there, he showed the world what authentic leadership looks like.</p><p>Lt. General Russel Honore (U.S. Army, retired) served in the military for 37 years. He led the U.S. Dept. of Defense response to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 and was a commanding general in the Middle East and in Korea. He served in a variety of command and staff positions focused on Defense Support of Civil Authorities and Homeland Defense. A highly decorated soldier, he received numerous awards and medals, including the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, Legion of Merit, Bronze Star, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal and Kuwait Liberation Medal. Today he is a business consultant, public speaker, Senior Scientist for the Gallup Organization, and CNN contributor on topics related to disaster preparedness. He holds a B.S. Degree in Vocational Agriculture from Southern University and an M.A. in Human Resources from Troy State. A native of Lakeland, Louisiana, he and his wife Beverly live in Baton Rouge, and they have four grown children.I met General Honor� when most of America did, when he marched onto the scene and took control of a rapidly deteriorating post-Katrina New Orleans. He was the leader America needed: brave, disciplined, decisive and ready to ignore convention to get the job done. This book shows how to emulate his brand of leadership in whatever we do. -Ali Velshi, CNN Anchor &amp; Chief Business Correspondent --Ali Velshi, CNN<br><br>Like Andrew Jackson, Gen. Honor� rode in to save New Orleans at a time of dire need. In this book he looks at the leadership lessons he learned from Hurricane Katrina and his years of service in the Army.

Compulsively readable, Logue's poetry flies off the page, and his compelling descriptions of the horrors of war have a surreal, dreamlike quality that has been compared to the films of Kurosawa. Retaining the great poem's story line but rewriting every incident, Logue brings the Trojan War to life for modern audiences.</p><p>George Steiner, praising Christopher Logue's brilliant reconstruction of Homer's work, writes that this book has the "mystery of a creative echo," that it is a "translation of genius." Some combination of a translation, an adaptation, and a new poem inspired from an old wellspring, <i>War Music</i> is violent, beautiful, hypnotic, and terrifying. This is Homer for the era of Stephen King and Quentin Tarentino.<b>Christopher Logue</b> is a poet who has also written screenplays and acted in several films.

The only totally and truly American civilian suit.<br>&#x2014;Cab Calloway, <i>The Hepster's Dictionary</i>, 1944</p><p>Before the fashion statements of hippies, punks, or hip-hop, there was the zoot suit, a striking urban look of the World War II era that captivated the imagination. Created by poor African American men and obscure tailors, the "drape shape" was embraced by Mexican American pachucos, working-class youth, entertainers, and swing dancers, yet condemned by the U.S. government as wasteful and unpatriotic in a time of war. The fashion became notorious when it appeared to trigger violence and disorder in Los Angeles in 1943&#x2014;events forever known as the "zoot suit riot." In its wake, social scientists, psychiatrists, journalists, and politicians all tried to explain the riddle of the zoot suit, transforming it into a multifaceted symbol: to some, a sign of social deviance and psychological disturbance, to others, a gesture of resistance against racial prejudice and discrimination. As controversy swirled at home, young men in other places&#x2014;French zazous, South African tsotsi, Trinidadian saga boys, and Russian stiliagi&#x2014;made the American zoot suit their own.</p><p>In <i>Zoot Suit</i>, historian Kathy Peiss explores this extreme fashion and its mysterious career during World War II and after, as it spread from Harlem across the United States and around the world. She traces the unfolding history of this style and its importance to the youth who adopted it as their uniform, and at the same time considers the way public figures, experts, political activists, and historians have interpreted it. This outr� style was a turning point in the way we understand the meaning of clothing as an expression of social conditions and power relations. Zoot Suit offers a new perspective on youth culture and the politics of style, tracing the seam between fashion and social action.</p></p><p>Kathy Peiss is Roy F. and Jeannette P. Nichols Professor of American History at the University of Pennsylvania. She is the author of Hope in a Jar: The Making of America&#39;s Beauty Culture, also available from the University of Pennsylvania Press, and Cheap Amusements: Working Women and Leisure in Turn-of-the-Century New York.<p>"An important and valuable book. The breadth of research upon which it is based and Peiss's determination to question conventional assumptions considerably enrich our understanding of the zoot."&#x2014;<i>Journal of American Studies</i></p><br><br><p>"Thorough, well-researched, and illuminating."&#x2014;<i>PopMatters</i></p><br><br><p>"Peiss is a creative and brilliant scholar and her book is a much-welcomed addition to the body of scholarship dedicated to unlocking the riddle of the zoot."&#x2014;<i>American Historical Review</i></p><br><br><p>"<i>Zoot Suit</i> is a sophisticated, independent minded, and valuable book; there should be more work like it in the field. Peiss's principled attention to evidence, her nuanced argument, and her willingness to question conventional assumptions about the meaning of popular forms all go a long way toward re-grounding American Studies in the lived world."&#x2014;Carlo Rotella, author of <i>Good With Their Hands: Boxers, Bluesmen, and Other Characters from the Rust Belt</i></p><br><br><p>"Kathy Peiss brilliantly unravels the many meanings of the zoot suit while sustaining the aesthetic pleasure of its creation in the complex cultural fabric of American life. <i>Zoot Suit</i> is a cultural history laced with the eye of ethnography, showing how an original African American sartorial style carried substantial symbolic power into the lives of Mexican American <i>pachucos suaves</i>, Jewish tailor trumpeters, and all who would wear 'the Drape' as a statement of hipness."&#x2014;Nick Spitzer, producer and host of <i>American Routes</i></p><br><br><p>"Refreshingly skeptical of the intellectual habit of reducing all cultural expression to the political."&#x2014;<i>Wall Street Journal</i></p></p><h2>Bush Pilot With a Briefcase;: The happy-go-lucky story of Grant McConachie</h2><p>Date not stated</p><p></p><h2>Things Fall Apart</h2><p>The contemporary African writer&#39;s classic novel depicting the destruction of traditional tribal life by the white man</p><p>One of the most widely read novels from Nigeria's most famous novelist, <i>Things Fall Apart</i> is a gripping study of the problem of European colonialism in Africa.

Visit her at GenaShowalter.com.<br><br>"How does that make you feel, Annabelle?" The male voice lingered over the word "feel," adding a disgusting layer of sleaze.<br><br>Annabelle tilted her head to the side, her gaze locked on Dr. Fitzherbert, though the other patients in the "trust circle" remained in her periphery. In his early forties, the doctor had thinning salt and pepper hair, dark brown eyes and perfectly tanned, though slightly lined, skin. At five ten, he was only a bit taller than her, on the thin side and, if you ignored the blackness of his soul, moderately attractive.<br><br>The longer she stared at him, silent, the more his lips curled upward. How that smugness grated&#x2014;not that she'd ever let him know. She would never willingly do anything to please him.<br><br>He'd drugged her once. Well, he'd drugged her every day of his two-month employment at the Moffat County Institution for the Criminally Insane. But last night he had sedated her with the express purpose of stripping her, touching her in ways he shouldn't and taking pictures.<br><br>Such a pretty girl, he'd said. Out there in the real world, a stunner like you would make me work for something as simple as a dinner date. Here, you're completely at my mercy. You're mine to do with as I please. Mine to control.<br><br>Humiliation still burned hot and deep, a fire in her blood. She'd like to say he was the first medical professional to violate her confidence. Yeah, she'd like to say that.<br><br>Over the last four years, the doctors and nurses in charge of her care had changed more times than her roommates, some of them shining stars of their profession, others simply going through the motions, doing what needed doing, while a select few were worse than the convicted criminals they were supposed to treat.<br><br>"Annabelle," Fitzpervert chided. "Silence isn't to be tolerated."<br><br>Well, then. "I feel like I'm one hundred percent cured. You should probably let me go."<br><br>He frowned with exasperation, all I'm such a good doctor and I could save you if only you'd let me. "You know better than to answer my questions so flippantly. That doesn't help you deal with your emotions or your problems. That doesn't help anyone here deal with their emotions or problems."<br><br>"Ah, so I'm a lot like you then." As if he cared about helping anyone but himself.<br><br>Several patients snickered. A couple merely drooled, foamy bubbles falling from babbling lips and catching on the shoulders of their gowns.<br><br>Fitzpervert's frown morphed into a scowl, the pretense of being here to help vanishing. He enjoyed his power, and he would not hesitate to strike at her for challenging it. "That smart mouth will get you into trouble." Not a threat. A vow.<br><br>Didn't matter. Her "smart mouth" was her life raft, her only way of fighting back. She lived in constant fear of creaking doors, shadows and footsteps. Of drugs and people and...things. Of herself.<br><br>The innocent, naive girl she'd once been was dead, killed the same day as her parents, the ghost somehow alive inside her, haunting her. At the worst times, she would remember things she had no business remembering.<br><br>Taste this, honey. It'll be the best thing you've ever eaten!<br><br>A terrible cook, her mother. Saki had loved to tweak recipes to "improve" them.<br><br>Did you see that? Another touchdown for the Sooners!<br><br>A diehard football fan, her dad. He had attended OU in Oklahoma for three semesters, and had never cut those ties.<br><br>She would remember, and she would cry. She would crave the things that had once been&#x2014;the things that should have been. But okay, fine, whatever. Whaa, whaa, whaa, she'd lost the people she loved. So had millions of other people. She was dealing.<br><br>When she failed to give an outward reaction to his threat, Fitzpervert's scowl darkened, his gaze dropping and lingering on the mouth he'd just rebuked. Within seconds, the fire in his eyes no longer spoke of anger but of lust.<br><br>The fear she so despised crept cold fingers down her spine. He'll come to my room tonight. Only this time, I'll be prepared. Her old toothbrush was now the perfect shank. One thing she'd learned over the years was that she could rely on no one but herself. Her complaints of foul treatment went unheeded, because most higher-ups believed she deserved what she got. If they believed her at all.<br><br>"I'd love to tell you how I feel, Dr. Fitzherbert," the man beside her said.<br><br>Fitzpervert cleared his throat before skating his attention to the serial arsonist who'd torched an entire apartment building, along with the men, women and children living inside of it.<br><br>As they discussed feelings and urges and ways to control them both, she tuned them out. For the most part, at least. Wherever she was, whomever she was with, she kept part of herself alert. A girl never knew when a threat would make itself known, be that threat human or...otherwise.<br><br>Out of habit, she studied her surroundings. The room was as dreary as her circumstances. There were ugly yellow water stains on the paneled ceiling, the walls were a peeling gray, and the floor carpeted with frayed brown shag. The uncomfortable metal chairs the occupants sat upon were the only furniture. Of course, Fitzpervert luxuriated on a special cushion.<br><br>Meanwhile, Annabelle's hands were cuffed behind her back and hooked to the sides of her chair, straining muscles and tendons already sore from abuse. Considering the amount of sedatives pumping through her system, the cuffs were overkill. But four weeks ago she'd brutally fought two fellow patients, and two weeks ago one of her nurses, so she was considered too much of a menace to leave unrestrained, no matter that she'd only been fighting to defend herself.<br><br>For the past thirteen days, she'd been kept in the hole, a dark, padded room where deprivation of the senses slowly drove you (genuinely) insane. She had been starved for contact, and had thought any interaction would do&#x2014;until Fitzpervert drugged and photographed her.<br><br>This morning, he'd arranged this outing for her. A be nice to me, and I'll be nice to you bribe.<br><br>If my parents could see me now... She bit back a sudden, choking sob as she imagined her mother. A fall of hair so black the strands had appeared blue, much like Annabelle's own. Eyes uptilted and golden, much like Annabelle's used to be. Skin a rich, creamy mix of honey and cinnamon, with not a single flaw. Saki Miller&#x2014;once Saki Tanaka&#x2014;had been born in Japan but raised in Georgetown, Colorado.<br><br>Saki's traditional parents had freaked when she and the white-as-can-be Rick Miller fell hopelessly in love and married. He'd come home from college on holiday, met her, and moved back to be with her.<br><br>Both Annabelle and her older brother were a combination of their parents' heritages. They shared their mother's hair and skin, the shape of her face, yet had their father's height and slender&#x2014;though in Brax's case, strong&#x2014;build.<br><br>Although, Annabelle's eyes no longer belonged to either Saki or Rick.<br><br>Once her eyes had been a pretty golden brown. Normal. After that horrible morning in her garage, after her arrest for their murders, after her conviction, her lifelong sentencing to this institution for the criminally insane, she'd finally found the courage to face herself in a mirror. What she'd seen had startled her. Eyes the color of winter ice, deep in the heart of an Arctic snowstorm, eerie and crystalline, barely blue with no hint of...humanity. Worse, she could see things with these eyes, things no one should ever have to see.<br><br>Case in point: as the "trust circle" yammered on, two creatures simply walked through the far wall, stopping to orient themselves. She looked at her fellow patients, expecting to hear shrieks of terror. No one else seemed to notice the visitors.<br><br>How could they not? One creature had the body of a horse and the torso of a man. Rather than skin, he was covered by glimmering silver...metal? His hooves were rust-colored and possibly some kind of metal as well, sharpened into deadly points.<br><br>His companion was shorter, with stooped shoulders weighed down by sharp, protruding horns, and legs twisted in the wrong direction. He wore a loincloth and nothing else, his chest furred, muscled and scarred.<br><br>The scent of rotten eggs filled the room, as familiar as it was horrifying. Fear and anger, though muted by the drugs in her system, nearly burned a hole in her chest. Her biceps and thighs tensed, her body preparing for attack. The creatures wouldn't leave without a fight. They never did.<br><br>They came in all shapes and sizes, all colors, both sexes&#x2014;and maybe something in-between&#x2014;but they had one thing in common: they always came for her. Unlike that morning with her parents, the creatures never attacked anyone but her.<br><br>Every doctor who'd ever treated her had tried to convince her that the beings were merely figments of her imagination. Complex hallucinations, they said. Despite the wounds the creatures always left behind&#x2014;wounds the doctors claimed she managed to inflict upon herself&#x2014;she sometimes believed them. That didn't stop her from fighting, though. Nothing could.<br><br>Glowing red gazes panned the room before at last settling on her. Both males smiled, their sharp, dripping fangs revealed.<br><br>"Mine," Horsey said.<br><br>"No. Mine!" Horns snapped.<br><br>Always they wanted to claim her as property, and she had no idea why.<br><br>"Only one way to settle this." Horsey licked his lips in anticipation.<br><br>"Fight," Horns agreed.<br><br>He did not mean they should fight each other. They planned to fight her. In their minds, subduing her meant owning her. Owning her meant touching her, beating her, belittling her.<br><br>They never raped her, though. No matter how evil they were, and some were worse than others, none of them had ever crossed that line. Annabelle knew many of them had wanted to, because several had even spread her legs and tried. But just before penetration, a wave of terror would wash over their faces and they would stumble away from her.<br><br>Don't you see, Annabelle? one of the doctors had told her once. The fact that these creatures will not rape you proves they are hallucinations. Your mind stops them from doing something you can't handle.<br><br>As if she could handle any of the rest. How do you explain the injuries I receive while bound?<br><br>We found the tools you hid in your room, Annabelle. Shanks, a hammer we're still trying to figure out how you got, glass shards. Shall I go on?<br><br>"Who goes first?" Horsey asked, drawing her out of her mind.<br><br>"Me."<br><br>"No, me."<br><br>Adrenaline crashed through her, burning and chilling her at the same time. You can do this. It's just more of the same. Though no other patients were aware of what was going on, they were all sensitive to her shift in mood. Grunts and groans erupted around her. Both men and women, young and old, writhed in their seats, wanting to run away.<br><br>The guards posted at the only exit stiffened, going on alert but unsure who was to blame.<br><br>Fitzpervert knew, pegging Annabelle with his patented king-of-the-world frown. "You look worried, Annabelle. Why don't you tell us what's bothering you, hmm? Are you regretting your earlier outburst?"<br><br>"Screw you, Fitzpervert." Her gaze returned to her targets. They were the bigger threat. "Your turn will come."<br><br>He sucked in a breath. "You are not allowed to speak to me that way, Miss Miller."<br><br>"You're right. Sorry. I meant, screw you, Dr. Fitzpervert." Unarmed did not mean helpless, she told herself, and neither did bound; today, she would prove it to the creatures and Fitzpervert.<br><br>"Spirited," Horsey said with a gleeful nod.<br><br>"So fun to break," Horns cackled.<br><br>From the corner of her eye, she saw the good doctor motion one of the guards forward, and she knew the guy would take her jaw in a punishing grip and shove her cheek against his stomach to hold her in place. A degrading and suggestive position that humiliated even as it cowed, preventing her from biting so that Fitzherbert could inject her with a sedative.<br><br>Have to act now. Perfect timing, too. In one fluid move, she slid as far back in her chair as possible, straightening her legs and pressing her stomach against her thighs. When her butt cleared the space between top and bottom, she bent her legs so that they came out over the top, the folding metal now positioned in front of her like a shield.<br><br>The guard reached her.<br><br>She swung to the left, slamming her shield&#x2014;and only weapon&#x2014;into his stomach. Oxygen gushed from his mouth as he hunched over. Another swing and she nailed the side of his head, sending him to the floor in an unconscious heap.<br><br>A few patients shouted with agitation, and a few others cheered her on. The droolers continued leaking. Fitzpervert rushed to the door to force the remaining guard to act as his buffer, as well as summon more with the single press of a button. An alarm screeched to life, tossing the already disconcerted patients into more of a frenzy.<br><br>No longer content to bicker on the sidelines, the creatures stalked toward her, slow and steady, taunting her.<br><br>"Oh, the things we'll do to you, little girl."<br><br>"Oh, how you'll scream!"<br><br>Closer...closer...almost within reach...totally within reach...they laughed.<br><br>She kept the chair raised, but she couldn't track both her adversaries at the same time as one claimed the front and the other claimed the back. They swiped at her with their claws and tried to bite her with their poisoned fangs.<br><br>I can handle this. She rammed the top of the chair under Horsey's chin, knocking his teeth together and his brain, if he had one, into the back of his skull. At the same time, she kicked out a leg behind her, punting Horns in the stomach. Both creatures stumbled away from her, their grins vanishing.<br><br>"That all you got, girls?" she goaded. Two more minutes, that's all she had, and then the guards would rush inside and tackle her, pinning her down, Fitzpervert and his needle taking charge. She wanted these creatures finished.<br><br>"Let's find out," Horsey hissed, pushing the arsonist at Annabelle.<br><br></p><h2>Decorating a Room of One&#x2019;s Own: Conversations on Interior Design with Miss Havisham, Jane Eyre, Victor Frankenstein, Elizabeth Bennet, Ishmael, and Other Literary Notables</h2><p>What would <i>Little Women</i> be without the charms of the March family&#x2019;s cozy New England home?

"Highly readable."</p><p>"A haunting story that uncovers the pain of several high school students," according to Teenreads.com. "It explores the tragedies of school violence and how the result of bullying can go to the most dramatic extreme.

Here is yet another school shooting story that begins with bullying and ends with disaster--a type that is becoming almost a sub-genre of YA fiction. Yet Walter Dean Myers, winner of many awards for his young adult novels, brings freshness and new anguish to this familiar tale (and growing social problem) of unstable victim tormented by bullies to homicidal rage. Following the example of his own masterwork <i>Monster</i>, Myers uses different perspectives in the aftermath of the "incident" to reveal the characters and to tell the story: interviews with Cameron and Carla by The Harrison County School Safety Committee, newspaper reports, a police report, Len's handwritten "die-ary" of his deranged thoughts, and finally, a grim medical examiner's report. The contrasts and contradictions in these various perspectives challenge readers to produce their own versions of why Cameron and Carla became Len's followers and what could have prevented this tragedy and others like it in real life.

Segu�n (Volume 20) (Fred H. and Ella Mae Moore Texas History Reprint Series)</h2><p>Scion of one of San Antonio&#x2019;s leading early families, Juan Nepomuceno Segu�n grew up in a Texas beset by violence and destruction. During the 1820s he matured in a household that welcomed Stephen F. Austin, and like many prominent Tejanos, the young Segu�n came to see Anglo-Americans as a boon to the development of his beloved homeland. With the eruption of rebellion in Texas in October 1835, he volunteered for service in the Texas army and was involved in some of the most memorable events in the War of Independence, from the siege of Bexar to the Runaway Scrape and the battle of San Jacinto.<br><br>As the most prominent Tejano military figure during the war, and an important political figure thereafter, Segu�n made enemies among the newly arriving Anglo-Americans unaware of the contributions of numerous Tejanos to the Texas cause. His opposition to land-grabbers in the San Antonio area and the machinations of political enemies while serving as mayor of San Antonio forced him to seek safety in Mexico, where he was impressed into military service. Among his controversial actions during his six-year exile were involvement in Gen. Adri�n Woll&#x2019;s occupation of San Antonio in September 1842 and command of a Mexican cavalry company during the Mexican War.<br><br>After his return to Texas in 1848, he became involved in San Antonio politics and was a founding member of the Bexar County Democratic Party. He served as an election precinct chairman and as Wilson County judge during Reconstruction before finally retiring in 1870 to Nuevo Laredo, where two of his sons had set up residence. He died in the Mexican border town in 1890.<br><br>Jes�s F. de la Teja has written the most extensive biographical study yet done on this controversial Tejano, who deserves a place among the more familiar names in the litany of the illustrious patriots of the Texas Revolution. Here is a wealth of information for serious historians but, even more, a readable and informative account for any person interested in early Texas history.

Aside from that amazing gig, Aimee has made a fool of herself in martial arts training, survived college, dabbled in ceramics, owned a coffee shop, braved leading the youth group with her husband, become a Bible study teacher and blogger, and done a little speaking on the side. Since her children's schedules have majorly cut into her social life, she has resorted to writing."This is a fine book, written with gusto and infectious enthusiasm by a lady who glories in the counter cultural role of being a housewife and yet moves beyond that to delight in the character of God himself, the salvation he has wrought, and the lives he calls his people to live.

But all is lost when the Nazis march across Europe, the Horowitz family's possessions are confiscated, and Simon and his father and brother are sent to Dachau.

Like the author, the novel's protagonist, Jane Takagi-Little, is a Japanese-American documentary filmmaker; like Ozeki, who was once commissioned by a beef lobbying group to make television shows for the Japanese market, Jane is invited to work on a Japanese television show meant to encourage beef consumption via the not-so-subliminal suggestion that prime rib equals a perfect family: <blockquote> TO: AMERICAN RESEARCH STAFF<br> FROM: Tokyo Office<br> DATE: January 5, 1991<br> RE: <i>My American Wife!</i>...<br> <p> Here is list of IMPORTANT THINGS for <i>My American Wife!</i><br> </p><p> DESIRABLE THINGS:<br> 1.

Naturally, the emphasis is on meat, and Ozeki has fun with out-there recipes such as rump roast in coke and beef fudge; but as Jane becomes more familiar with her subject, she becomes increasingly aware of the beef industry's widespread practice of using synthetic estrogens on their cattle and determines to sabotage the program. </p><p> Cut to Tokyo where Akiko Ueno struggles through the dull misery of life with her brutish husband, who happens to be in charge of the show's advertising. After seeing one of Jane's subversive episodes about a vegetarian lesbian couple, Akiko gets in touch and the two women plot to expose the meat industry's hazardous practices. Romance, humor, intrigue, and even a message--<i>My Year of Meats</i> has it all. This is a book that even a vegetarian would love.</p>Ruth L.

They lay there on their daybed, men all standing over round, fingering pocket chains and hands curled about gin bottle necks. The girls lay there on plump pillows piled high with soft fringes twirling between delicate fingers, their lips wet with syrups, tonics, sticky with balms, their faces freshly powdered, arching up, waiting to be attended to by men, our men, the city's men.

She would start Monday as a filing clerk and stenographer at the Werden Clinic. She passed the typing test and the dictation test and Dr. Milroy, the director, who was very tall and wore tinted spectacles and smelled sweetly of aniseeds, hired her right then and there, taking her small hand between his palms deep as serving dishes, as softly worn as the leather pew Bibles passed through three generations' hands in the First Methodist Church of Grand Rapids, and said, "My dear Mrs. Seeley, welcome to our little desert hideaway. We are so glad you will be joining us. I have assured your husband you will be happy here. The entire Werden community welcomes you to its bosom." </p><p> On Sunday night, late, he packed his suitcase for his long trip, first to Nogales, then Estaci�n Dimas, then ninety miles on muleback to Tayoltita. The mining company didn't care about revoked medical licenses. They were eager to have him. But, with her, he had always been clear: where he was going was no place for a woman. He would have to go alone. </p><p> When he was finished packing, he sat her down on the bed and spoke softly to her for some time, spoke softly of his grief in leaving her but with solemn, gravely worded promises that he would return in the spring, would return by Easter, arms filled with lilies, and with all past troubles behind them. </p><p> And on Monday morning at seven o'clock her husband, having made all these arrangements, walked her to the trolley and kissed her discreetly on the cheek, his chin crushing her new hat, and headed himself to the train depot, one battered suitcase in hand. As she watched him through the trolley window, as she watched him, slope-shouldered in that ancient brown suit, hat too tight, gait slow and lurching, she thought, <i>Who is that poor man, walking so beaten, face gray, eyes struck blank? Who is that sad fellow? My goodness, what a life must he lead to be so broken and alone!</i> </p><p> The doctors at the clinic were all kind as could be, and all seemed concerned that she felt comfortable and safe in her rooming house. They left a cactus blossom on her desk as a welcome gift and offered her a tour of the State Capitol, pointing proudly to its copper dome, which could be viewed from the clinic's thirdfloor windows. Right away, Dr. Milroy and his wife began inviting her to Sunday dinner and she heard again about the one hundred varieties of cactus she might see around town and she heard that no other place in the world is blessed with so many days of sunshine and she heard how, as she must know, the desert is God's great health-giving laboratory. Then, at the end of the evening, Mrs. Milroy always sent her home with a dish steaming over with creamed corn casserole, a knot of pork, sweet carrots in honey glaze. </p><p> "You're nothing but a whisper of a girl. But you'll need something on your bones for when you start your family. When Dr. Seeley comes back, you know he'll be ready for a son. Am I right?" </p><p> She smiled, she always smiled. Dr. Seeley hadn't talked of sons, of children since before the first monthlong stretch at St. Bartholomew's narcotics ward. They'd never talked much of babies, even as she was sure when she married three years, seven months back that she'd be near the third time large with child by now, like all the girls she knew. </p><p> It was Friday, her fifth day at the clinic, and she had seen Nurse Louise stalking the halls more than once, stalking them, a lioness. A long-limbed girl with a thick brush of dark red hair crowning a pale, pie face, painted-on brows thin as kidsilk and a tilting Scotch nose. When she walked, her hips slung and her chest bobbed up round apples and the men on the ward took notice -- my, how could they not? She was not beautiful, but she had a bristling, crackling energy about her and it was like she was always winking at you and nodding her head as if saying, always, even when stacking X-rays, <i>C'mon, sweet face, c'mon</i>. </p><p> And now here was Nurse Louise dropping herself, hard, in the chair across from Marion in the luncheon room. She smelled like licorice and talcum powder. </p><p> "That's for beans, kid," she said, jabbing her thumb dismissively at Marion's jelly sandwich. "Have a hunk of my brown bread. Ginny -- that's my roommate -- swabbed it up good with plum butter. Tell me that ain't the stuff." </p><p> And Marion took the wedge offered her and it smelled like Mother's kitchen even if Mother never made any bread but white or sometimes milk-and-water bread. And the plum butter, well, that stung sweet in her mouth since she hadn't had much but bean soup since Dr. Seeley left her, left her all alone five days past. </p><p> "What's your name, answer me now with your cakehole plug full," she said, laughing. "I'm Louise Mercer. I've been here going on a year now, so I guess there's not much I don't know. I'm happy to show you all the dials and knobs and pulleys, if you like. So nothing crashes down on that slippery blond head of yours." </p><p> "Well, I'm Marion. Marion Seeley," she finally got out, eyeing a dab of butter still smeared on her thumb. </p><p> "Go on, Marion." Louise smiled, nodding toward the pearly butter. "We don't believe, none of us, in wasting fine things." </p><p> Suddenly, she was under Louise's red-tipped wing and everything became easier. She learned the best place to hang her hat and coat so they didn't smell of disinfectant, the trolley route that'd get her home seven minutes faster and two blocks closer to boot and that you should punch the clock before you even set your purse down each morning. </p><p> Each day, they ate lunch together and Louise gave her the what's what on everyone at the clinic. The doctors no longer seemed half so frightening once Louise had told her about the one who was always pinching nurses' behinds, and the one who tipped his bill in his office all day long, the one who never even gave a pretty penny to the St. Ursula's Annual Blind Children Drive and the one who had ended up here on account of losing his medical license in the state of Missouri for operating a still in his office. </p><p> Louise always brought treats -- small cakes, a glass canister of baked beans with brown sugar, a sack of jelly nougats, a crimson jar of pickled beets. Wanting to return the favor, Marion brought in her mother's sturdy currant jelly and, later in the week, steamed bread she had spent all evening making in the kitchen of the rooming house. Neither could eat it. Louise crossed her eyes like Ben Turpin. </p><p> "It's for the birds, kid," she said. "But a girl as pretty as you, what could it matter?" </p><p> Marion was embarrassed, mostly because she thought she was a very good homemaker and Dr. Seeley had dined on her food for years with never a complaint. He always smiled and said, "Very good, Marion. Very fine, indeed." </p><p> "You come by our place," Louise said. "You should try my creamed onions. You'll think your tongue ran across a cloud." </p><p> What might a cloud taste like, she wondered. Like Mother's snow pudding made for birthdays and Sunday summer suppers. No, no, like dew, like rain gathering on the edge of your winter muffler, brushing against your lips. </p><p> Copyright � 2009 by Megan Abbott</p></p><h2>Dorothy L. Sayers: Her Life and Soul</h2><p>Mystery writer Dorothy Sayers is loved and remembered, most notably, for the creation of sleuths Lord Peter Wimsey and Harriet Vane. As this biography attests, Sayers was also one of the first women to be awarded a degree from Oxford, a playwright, and an essayist--but also a woman with personal joys and tragedies. Here, Reynolds, a close friend of Sayers, presents a convincing and balanced portrait of one of the 20th century's most brilliant, creative women. 30 b&amp;w photos.</p><p>An Italian scholar and translator, Barbara Reynolds completed the translation of Dante&#39;s Divine Comedy which Dorothy L. Sayers left unfinished when she died. Dr Reynolds has told the story of this collaboration in The Passionate Intellect: Dorothy L. Sayers&#39; Encounter with Dante. She has also translated Dante&#39;s La Vita Nuova and Ariosto&#39;s Orlando Furioso, and was the general editor of The Cambridge Italian Dictionary. More recently, Dr Reynolds founded the journal Seven, to which she has contributed articles on Dorothy L. Sayers. She is the President of the Dorothy L. Sayers Society, and has frequently lectured at the society&#39;s conferences. She is currently working on an edition of the Sayers letters, of which the first three volumes have now appeared.Another ``interim report'' on the life (1893-1957) of the creator of Lord Peter Wimsey and reluctant Christian apologist, by a longtime friend, completer of Sayers's translation of Dante and author of The Passionate Intellect: Dorothy L. Sayers' Encounter with Dante (1989- -not reviewed). The problem all Sayers's biographers face is to reconcile her early career as a pioneer and leading theorist of the formal detective story with the religious plays, essays, and lectures to which she committed her last 15 years. In the absence of a collected edition of Sayers's letters, Reynolds still tries to make Sayers speak for herself whenever possible by quoting letters, conversations, and passages from her voluminous writings. The result is a view of the writer that Sayers herself would likely have approved of: as a generous, fiercely intelligent woman whose cardinal passion, her intellectual ardor, led her from Oxford to the hand-to-mouth London bohemianism that spawned the inimitably foppish Wimsey and then, quite logically, to a defense of the writer's imagination (The Mind of the Maker) that set forth Sayers's understanding of the Trinity. Despite some stiffness in the early chapters, and a disinclination to criticize her subject even mildly, Reynolds captures the ardent nature that sustained Sayers through her unrequited love affairs, her pregnancy without marriage, her lifelong support of the son she never publicly acknowledged, and the writing she felt certain from the beginning was her vocation. It isn't until the popular Wimsey books are behind, though, that Reynolds's matching passion comes out--she calls The Mind of the Maker and The Man Born to Be King Sayers's ``two greatest works''--and the biography comes into its own, even though only a few years of Sayers's life remain before Reynolds encounters the preemptive shadow of her own earlier book. Best, then, on the later years--the years of her own friendship with Sayers--that Reynolds has already described so sympathetically. Fans of Lord Peter may feel let down.

The Wild Weasels in Desert Storm: The Elimination of Iraq&#39;s Air Defence</h2><p>This book is based on a journal Jim Schreiner kept during his deployment to the Persian Gulf region for Operations DESERT SHIELD and DESERT STORM. Building upon that record and the recollections of other F-4G Wild Weasel aircrew, the authors show a slice of what life and war were like during that time. The pawns in the game, the ones that had to actually do the fighting and dying, were the hundreds of thousands of men and women who left their homes and families to live for seemingly endless months in the vast, trackless desert while the world stage-play unfolded. To them, the war was deeply personal. At times, the war was scary; at other times, it was funny as hell. Usually, if you survive the former, it turns into the latter.</p><p>Brick Eisel is a recently retired USAF officer with an extensive background in tactical aviation as well as having served as a military historian.

The Hundred Years' War ravaged the continent, yet gallantry, chivalry, and literary brilliance flourished in the courts of England and elsewhere. It was a world in transition, soon to be replaced by the Renaissance and the Age of Exploration - and John of Gaunt was its central figure.</p> <p>In today's terms, John of Gaunt was a multibillionaire with a brand name equal to Rockefeller. He fought in the Hundred Years' War, sponsored Chaucer and proto-Protestant religious thinkers, and survived the dramatic Peasants' Revolt, during which his sumptuous London residence was burned to the ground. As head of the Lancastrian branch of the Plantagenet family, Gaunt was the unknowing father of the War of the Roses; after his death, his son usurped the crown from his nephew, Richard II. Gaunt's adventures represent the culture and mores of the Middle Ages as those of few others do, and his death is portrayed in <b>The Last Knight</b> as the end of that enthralling period.</p></p><p><p>Norman F. Cantor was Emeritus Professor of History, Sociology, and Comparative Literature at New York University. His many books include <em>In the Wake of the Plague</em>, <em>Inventing the Middle Ages</em>, and <em>The Civilization of the Middle Ages</em>, the most widely read narrative of the Middle Ages in the English language. He died in 2004.</p>John of Gaunt (1340&#x2013;1399) was one of the wealthiest men of late&#x2013;14th-century Europe and an exemplar of the rough and refined values of his class. He fought in the Hundred Years War, was targeted in the 1381 Peasants' Rebellion and was a patron of Chaucer. By his first wife, he became Duke of Lancaster and founded the Lancastrian branch of the English royal family; by his second, he had a claim to the throne of Castile; and by his third, he founded another family line that married back into the royal Tudors. Cantor (<i>In the Wake of the Plague</i>), a widely read authority on medieval Europe, traces these connections and demonstrates how several strands of European history cross through Gaunt. Thoroughly dismissing Annales emphasis on the continuity of peasant life, he argues that it is aristocratic life that has remained unchanged. In modern terms, Gaunt was a multibillionaire with free rein to live his life as he pleased, whether bullying members of Parliament, marrying his mistress or dabbling in the heretical teachings of John Wycliffe. This provocative argument is undermined by simplistic writing and the making of points by assertion rather than proof or argument. A remarkably anachronistic imagined defense of slavery is put into the mouth of Henry the Navigator (Gaunt's grandson), the Portuguese patron of exploration, and stretches the limits of what might be considered Gaunt's heritage. Assumptions about personal motivations based on fragmentary evidence are not sufficient to validate the intimate portrait Cantor claims to present. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Box's tough, tender, and engrossing series, which just keeps getting better. When a forest service supervisor is murdered right after a manic shooting spree that slaughtered a herd of elk, a mysterious stranger who trains falcons and carries an unusual weapon is arrested for the slaying. Then a special investigative team headed by a devious, vindictive woman arrives in Saddlestring, bent on a bloody confrontation with a group of government-hating survivalists camped out on federal land. Among then is Jeannie Keeley, who abandoned her daughter April three years earlier. Since then, April has become like a daughter to Joe and his wife Marybeth, and a sister to their own children. Now April is right in the middle of what promises to be the last stand for the ragged band of refugees from the firestorms of Waco, Ruby Ridge, and the Montana Freemen, and only Nate the falconer, who owes Joe his life for finding the real killer of the supervisor and freeing him from jail, may be able to save her before the Bighorn Mountains are covered in blood.

But we do know that there will never again be another book like it. Jadoo, a Hindi word meaning "Black Magic," captures a world that is now lost to us-the strange, dark, mysterious world that was once called the "Orient." This story of a real-life Indiana Jones of the 1950s named John Keel contains everything but a trip to Venus in a flying saucer--a subject our newsman/explorer would become famous for a decade later. In Egypt, the fearless Keel was cursed by a mummy and befriended members of a strange snake-charming cult.

I am profoundly moved: what a work! And to think I&#x2019;d never heard the name of Marcel Schwob. Who is he?&#x201d;&#x2015;Rainer Maria Rilke</strong></p>Marcel Schwob&#x2019;s 1896 novella <i>The Children&#x2019;s Crusade</i> retells the medieval legend of the exodus of some 30,000 children from all countries to the Holy Land, who traveled to the shores of the sea, which&#x2015;instead of parting to allow them to march on to Jerusalem&#x2015;instead delivered them to merchants who sold them into slavery in Tunisia or delivered them to a watery death. It is a cruel and sorrowful story mingling history and legend, which Schwob recounts through the voices of eight different protagonists: a goliard, a leper, Pope Innocent III, a cleric, a qalandar and Pope Gregory IX, as well as two of the marching children, whose naive faith eventually turns into growing fear and anguish.<p></p><p>Though it is a tale drawn from the early 13th century, Schwob presents it through a modern framework of shifting subjectivity and fragmented coherency, and its subject matter and its succession of different narrative perspectives has been seen as an influence on and precursor to such diverse works as Alfred Jarry&#x2019;s <i>The Other Alcestis</i>, Ryunosuke Akutagawa&#x2019;s &#x201c;In a Grove,&#x201d; William Faulkner&#x2019;s <i>As I Lay Dying</i> and Jerzy Andrzejewski&#x2019;s <i>The Gates of Paradise</i>. It is a tale told by many yet understood by few, a mosaic surrounding a void, describing a world in which innocence must perish.</p></p><p></p><h2>Moving From Shame to Self-Worth: Preaching &amp; Pastoral Care</h2><p>This inspiring and practical book has three parts. Part 1 explores how Jesus came to grips with the shame and humiliation he faced in his own life and how we can imitate his manner of handling shame. Part 2 focuses on how Jesus dealt with the shame that others brought to him and the implications this has for how we can overcome shame by internalizing and reenacting Jesus&#39; stories in our lives. Part 3 explores the parables of Jesus and their implications for helping us live lives grounded in nonshame-based values.</p><p>EDWARD P.

A face in a crowd holding a sign that says, &#x201c;Hi Mom, Guess What!&#x201d; at a gay rights rally. Two lovers kissing under a tree. These indelible images are among the thousands housed in the New York Public Library&#x2019;s archive of photographs of 1960s and &#x2019;70s LGBTQ history from photojournalists Kay Tobin Lahusen and Diana Davies. Lahusen is a pioneering photojournalist who captured pivotal moments in the LGBTQ civil rights movement. Davies, in turn, is one of the most important photojournalists who documented gay, lesbian, and trans liberation, as well as civil rights, feminist, and antiwar movements.</p><p>This powerful collection&#x2015;which captures the energy, humor, and humanity of the groundbreaking protests that surrounded the Stonewall Riots&#x2015;celebrates the diversity of this rights movement, both in the subjects of the photos and by presenting Lahusen and Davies&#x2019; distinctive work and perspectives in conversation with each other.

They enliven the uncommonly courageous men and women who refused to accept the disparaging labels of their time. For those of us lucky enough to live in more accepting times, this is crucial history. But it is also a record of the fact that these people, in among their gestures of nobility, were fun and funny and lively and romantic; in short it shows, as nothing has before, the touching, vulnerable humanity of the people who remade our society.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Andrew Solomon, author of <em>Far from the Tree</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;What a surprise! <em>Love and Resistance</em> is a delicious collection of photographs, dozens of them never before published. Here in the early years of the gay movement are the many people, now famous or not, playing out their roles in what was then a barely inaugurated rebellion. The photos are the work of two gifted artists, Kay Tobin Lahusen and Diana Davies, both of whom wonderfully capture the excitement and exuberance of the birth of gay liberation.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Martin Duberman author of <em>Stonewall, Cures</em>, and <em>Luminous Traitor: The Just and Daring Life of Roger Casement</em></strong></p><h2>Organized Crime in Chicago: Beyond the Mafia</h2><p><p></p>This book provides a comprehensive sociological explanation for the emergence and continuation of organized crime in Chicago. Tracing the roots of political corruption that afforded protection to gambling, prostitution, and other vice activity in Chicago and other large American cities, Robert M. Lombardo challenges the dominant belief that organized crime in America descended directly from the Sicilian Mafia. According to this widespread "alien conspiracy" theory, organized crime evolved in a linear fashion beginning with the Mafia in Sicily, emerging in the form of the Black Hand in America's immigrant colonies, and culminating in the development of the Cosa Nostra in America's urban centers.&nbsp;Looking beyond this Mafia paradigm, this volume argues that the development of organized crime in Chicago and other large American cities was rooted in the social structure of American society. Specifically, Lombardo ties organized crime to the emergence of machine politics in America's urban centers. From nineteenth-century vice syndicates to the modern-day Outfit, Chicago's criminal underworld could not have existed without the blessing of those who controlled municipal, county, and state government. These practices were not imported from Sicily, Lombardo contends, but were bred in the socially disorganized slums of America where elected officials routinely franchised vice and crime in exchange for money and votes. This book also traces the history of the African-American community's participation in traditional organized crime in Chicago and offers new perspectives on the organizational structure of the Chicago Outfit, the traditional organized crime group in Chicago.<p></p></p><p><p></p>Explaining Chicago's mix of crime, corruption, and politics<p></p><p></p><b>Robert M.

In two engaging essays, the authors demonstrate that a huge gap existed between the democratic, capitalist, and global vision of the post-World War II peace that most Americans believed in and the dictatorial, xenophobic, and regional approach that characterized Soviet policies. The authors argue that repeated failures to find mutually acceptable solutions to concrete problems led to the rapid development of the Cold War, and they conclude that, given the respective concerns and perspectives of the time, both superpowers were largely justified in their courses of action. Supplemented by primary sources, including documents detailing Soviet espionage in the United States during the 1930s and 1940s and correspondence between Premier Josef Stalin and Foreign Minister V. M. Molotov during postwar meetings, this is the first book to give equal attention to the U.S. and Soviet policies and perspectives.</p><p>Ralph B.

It is genuinely and uniquely bi-national in its approach. The co-authored essays provide insight into the complex issues in Soviet-American relations, and the documents are well-chosen.

It has, among many other achievements, revealed thousands of galaxies in what seemed to be empty patches of sky; transformed our knowledge of black holes; found dwarf planets with moons orbiting other stars; and measured precisely how fast the universe is expanding. In <i>Handprints on Hubble</i>, retired astronaut Kathryn Sullivan describes her work on the NASA team that made all of this possible. Sullivan, the first American woman to walk in space, recounts how she and other astronauts, engineers, and scientists launched, rescued, repaired, and maintained Hubble, the most productive observatory ever built.</p><p>Along the way, Sullivan chronicles her early life as a &#x201c;Sputnik Baby,&#x201d; her path to NASA through oceanography, and her initiation into the space program as one of &#x201c;thirty-five new guys.&#x201d; (She was also one of the first six women to join NASA's storied astronaut corps.) She describes in vivid detail what liftoff feels like inside a spacecraft (it's like &#x201c;being in an earthquake and a fighter jet at the same time&#x201d;), shows us the view from a spacewalk, and recounts the temporary grounding of the shuttle program after the Challenger disaster.<br>Sullivan explains that &#x201c;maintainability&#x201d; was designed into Hubble, and she describes the work of inventing the tools and processes that made on-orbit maintenance possible. Because in-flight repair and upgrade was part of the plan, NASA was able to fix a serious defect in Hubble's mirrors&#x2015;leaving literal and metaphorical &#x201c;handprints on Hubble.&#x201d; </p><p><i>Handprints on Hubble</i> was published with the support of the MIT Press Fund for Diverse Voices.</p></p><p>Kathryn D. Sullivan is a NASA astronaut (retired), former Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and an inductee in the Astronaut Hall of Fame.<p>Perhaps the most important spacecraft ever launched in a single mission is the Hubble Space Telescope. HST has provided to humanity more knowledge of our universe than any instrument since Galileo first peered through ground glass. Astronaut Kathy Sullivan was there at the beginning of Hubble's design. As much as anyone, her handprints are on this magnificent space observatory. Now, in this fast-paced memoir, she tells us of the frustrations and triumphs of her storied career as the first American woman to walk in space and how she came to deploy the Hubble in orbit. A page-turner, Sullivan's memoir is for more than space buffs. It's for anyone who loves a good read about an adventurous life written by the person who lived it.</p>&#x2015;<b>Homer Hickam</b>, author of Rocket Boys/October Sky</p><h2>The Sealwoman&#39;s Gift</h2><p>A Zoe Ball ITV Book Club Pick &#39;Sally Magnusson has taken an amazing true event and created a brilliant first novel.

In a notorious historical event, pirates raided the coast of Iceland and abducted 400 people into slavery in Algiers. Among them a pastor, his wife, and their children.

Based on this historical study, he concludes with a constructive proposal for how Christology and anthropology should work together to inform our view of what it means to be human.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many theologians begin their discussion of the human person by claiming that in some way Jesus Christ reveals what it means to be &#x201c;truly human,&#x201d; but this often has little impact in the material presentation of their anthropology. Although modern theologians often fail to reflect robustly on the relationship between Christology and anthropology, this was not the case throughout church history. In this book, examine seven key theologians and discover their important contributions to theological anthropology.</p></p><p><p>Marc Cortez (PhD, University of St. Andrews) is Associate Professor of Theology at Wheaton College Graduate School. He is author of <em>Theological Anthropology</em> and <em>Embodied Souls, Ensouled Bodies</em> and has published articles in academic journals such as <em>International Journal of Systematic Theology</em>, <em>Scottish Journal of Theology</em>, and <em>Westminster Theological Journal</em>. Marc blogs at Everyday Theology (marccortez.com), writes a monthly article for <em>Christianity.com</em>, and had articles featured on <em>The Gospel Coalition</em> and <em>Christian Post</em>.</p>In this book one of today&#x2019;s foremost experts on theological anthropology reintroduces some neglected thinkers and launches an intriguing new research angle. Marc Cortez has some surprises in store for those who think they know the exact parameters of what counts as Christology or what it means for Jesus to embrace our humanity. -- Daniel J. Treier, Blanchard Professor of Theology, Wheaton college Graduate School<br><br>Goods theologians listen before they speak, and this volume provides a master class in learning how to listen well. In chapter after chapter, Marc Cortez shows us what it looks like to hear the voices of the church&#x2019;s greatest theologians clearly and interpret them charitably. The diverse cast of characters and provocative topics make for absorbing reading, and we learn how to speak of Jesus Christ, human beings, and our life in relationship with God better than before. This book comes highly recommended for students and scholars alike. -- Keith L. Johnson, Associate Professor of Theology, Wheaton College<br><br>As he leads readers through important historical figures, Cortez makes a valuable contribution to the doctrine of the human being and to Christology. He demonstrates how key biblical themes have been taken up in the tradition and, in doing so, points readers to what it means to be human in Christ. This book will be valuable to students and professionals alike. -- Beth Felker Jones, Associate Professor of Theology, Wheaton College<br><br>In this fine book, Marc Cortez lends his well-trained ear to the often wonderful (and occasionally weird) tradition of Christian teaching about human beings, specifically, what it has to say about how the person and work of Jesus Christ shapes our understanding of human being and action. The result is a clear, exceptionally learned, and rewarding overview of different approaches to &#x201c;Christological anthropology&#x201d; in the Christian tradition. This book will prove a useful resource to anyone seeking to develop a theological anthropology that honors the supremacy of Jesus Christ. -- Scott R. Swain, professor of systematic theology and Academic Dean, Reformed Theological Seminary, Orlando<br><br>In what way does God&#x2019;s entering history in the fully and truly human Jesus serve to ground or establish a Christian anthropology? How does Christological warrant for anthropological claims extend beyond ethics to offer a fuller picture of what it means to be human? With careful and insightful analysis Cortez engages key theological voices from the history of the church and unfolds a striking breadth to the ways that Christology informs anthropology. In so doing, this volume unearths the essential starting points to continued constructive work in Christian anthropology with unparalleled clarity and comprehension. -- Kevin Diller, Ph.D, Associate Professor of Philosophy and Religion, Taylor University<br><br>Marc Cortez has established himself as one of the more important thinkers around what it means to be human in theological perspective. In this latest offering, his theological acumen, sense of humour, and ability to adeptly navigate large swathes of the Tradition result in a work which is as profound as it is useful. In an age where the centrality of Christ is too-often replaced by a cultural sentimentality, Cortez reminds us that what it means to be human can only be defined in relation to Jesus Christ; and knowing that, makes all the difference in the world. -- Dr. Myk Habets, Head of Carey Graduate School, Carey Baptist College, Auckland, New Zealand<br><br>Many scholars talk about doing 'theology of retrieval,' but Marc Cortez actually does it. Employing several fascinating case studies (involving Gregory of Nyssa, Julian of Norwich, Martin Luther, Friedrich Schleiermacher, Karl Barth, John Ziziouas, and James Cone), he looks wide and digs deep for insights into a theological anthropology that is properly Christological. The result is a work of erudition that sets the table for Cortez's own much-anticipated offerings. -- Thomas H. McCall, Professor of Biblical and Systematic Theology, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School<br><br>For those who take seriously the fact that there is one truly human being for and with us by the Spirit---Jesus Christ, Son of Mary and God---this is a helpful book. It sits us down with saints through the ages who have also considered the implications of Christ&#x2019;s humanity for our own. Cortez is a gracious host, inviting us to listen and hear, that we might hear more clearly when visiting these saints in their original &#x201c;homes.&#x201d; This makes for the best kind of resource book---one that welcomes, engages, and ultimately serves a critical need in the life of the Church. -- Cherith Fee Nordling, Associate Professor, Northern Seminary<br><br>What makes us human? And how does Jesus make a difference? Dr Cortez offers us a stimulating and convincing tour of the role of Christology in theological anthropologies from Gregory of Nyssa to James Cone, via Mother Julian of Norwich and Martin Luther, amongst others. The reader is invited to explore the varied ways in which major thinkers have made Jesus the key to being human, and to ask the crucial questions that will decide between their accounts. The readings are persuasive; the expositions lucid; and the whole is a compelling tour of the ways in which belief in Christ might change our vision of our common humanity. This is a quite excellent book; I commend it unreservedly. -- Stephen R. Holmes, Senior Lecturer in Theology, University of St. Andrews<br><br>At different periods in Christian history, different doctrines have ascended to the center of theological debate. I believe that in the early decades of the twenty-first century, the doctrine of humanity seems to be near the epicenter. I&#x2019;m grateful to Marc Cortez for this helpful, judicious survey of how different theologians have grounded their anthropology in their understanding of the person and work of Jesus Christ. Christological Anthropology in Historical Perspective is a welcome contribution to ongoing discussions of human nature. As in so many doctrinal discussions, we need to look to the past for wisdom for the present and future. Cortez helps us to do just that in this timely book. Highly recommended. -- Nathan A.

Ethie sets sail for St. John&#x2019;s Harbor, but a violent winter storm casts the steamship onto the rocky cliffs of northwest Newfoundland, threatening the passengers&#x2019; survival<br>Ninety-two passengers and crew, all eager to be reunited with family for the holidays, are now at the mercy of the stormy sea. Seeing the wrecked ship off the coast, a fishing family sends their dog Skipper, a hardworking and courageous Newfoundland, to brave the icy and dangerous waters to carry a lifeline from the sinking ship to shore.<br>In this minute-by-minute fictionalized account of the S.S. Ethie&#x2019;s dramatic voyage, Hillary Hyland vividly brings the adventure to life, showing the spirit of survival amongst the passengers and crew, as well as the strength and determination of a poor fishing family and their courageous dog to save those ninety-two souls.</p><p>Hilary Hyland is the author of the award-winning book,The Wreck of the Ethie. A popular speaker, she has given author presentations at more than 200 schools. She lives in Virginia.Grade 4-7-This book is a novelization of an event that occurred in 1919 off the coast of Newfoundland. A sudden, violent winter storm wrecked the ship SS Ethie against rocks about 100 yards from shore. The ferocity of the wind and waves prevented residents on shore from reaching the stranded passengers. A Newfoundland dog came to the rescue, swimming out to the boat and then returning with a cable with which a rescue system was devised. All 92 people were safely evacuated. The dog was later given an official commendation by the Canadian government. The author dramatically re-creates these events through the eyes of Patrick, a teen crewman on board the ship, and Colleen, the dog's young owner, who lives near the scene of the wreck. The fast-paced action, easy reading level, and black-and-white drawings will appeal to reluctant readers. The author's note contains factual information about the storm, shipwreck, and ensuing rescue. It, along with the glossary of nautical terms and maps of the area, helps to authenticate the factual nature of the book.<br><i>William C.

David Orrell argues that it has been trying to solve the wrong problem all along.<br> <br>Economics sees itself as the science of scarcity. Instead, it should be the science of money (which plays a surprisingly small role in mainstream theory). And money is a substance that turns out to have a quantum nature of its own.<br> <br>Just as physicists learn about matter by studying the exchange of particles at the subatomic level, so economics should begin by analysing the nature of money-based transactions. <i>Quantum Economics</i> therefore starts with the meaning of the phrase &#x2018;how much&#x2019; - or, to use the Latin word, quantum.<br> <br>From quantum physics to the dualistic properties of money, via the emerging areas of quantum finance and quantum cognition, this profoundly important book reveals that quantum economics is to neoclassical economics what quantum physics is to classical physics - a genuine turning point in our understanding. <br></p><p>David Orrell is a scientist and writer of books on science and economics. According to the Sunday Times &#x2018;Orrell is an engaging and witty writer, adept at explaining often complicated theories in clear language.&#x2019; His latest books are <i>The Money Formula: Dodgy Finance, Pseudo Science</i>, and <i>How Mathematicians Took Over the Markets</i>, written with Paul Wilmott; and <i>Economyths: 11 Ways Economics Gets It Wrong</i> (Icon Books, 2017).&#x2018;Rich with suggestive insights on every page and written in an accessible style, this book will both engage and infuriate its audience. For those of us who feel trapped in the professional cocoons of the like-minded, this book offers a chance to escape from the iron cages we have built.&#x2019; (Peter J. Katzenstein, Walter S. Carpente)<br><br>Orrell has explained his ideas in a very lively style, providing the history and a basic explanation of the physics; and goes on to explore the various consequences of this dual nature, which neo-classical economics did not foresee. The book should be read, not only by economists but also by all decision-makers.&#x2019; (Asghar Qadir, Professor of Physics, Nati)<br><br>&#x2018;On the cusp of an earlier revolution, Karl Marx said all that is solid melts into air and all that is holy is profaned. Constructing a less mechanistic and even more revolutionary science of quantum economics, David Orrell proves it so. Orrell does not dabble in metaphor or metaphysics: he intellectually, persuasively and corrosively transmutates money into a quantum phenomenon. In the process, classical economics is profaned to good effect and a quantum future glimmers as a real possibility.&#x2019; (James Der Derian, Chair of International)<br><br>&#x2018;As money becomes more digital and diffuse, it also becomes more quantum. In this timely and illuminating book, David Orrell brings us to the frontier of where economics, physics and psychology intersect. You&#x2019;ll never look at money the same again!&#x2019; (Dr Parag Khanna, author of Connectograph)<br><br>Beautifully written, inherently ethical, and often hilarious, this book is a must-read for anyone wanting to understand the weird, and getting weirder, world of modern finance.&#x2019; (Margaret Wertheim, author of Pythagoras&#x2019;)<br><br>&#x2018;Reading David Orrell&#x2019;s Quantum Economics is equivalent to playing a game of 3-D chess against the concept of value itself. The book easily switches between physical, economic and metaphysical conceptions of value, revealing their hidden parallels and paradoxes. The result is at once an explanation of our current economic predicament, a diagnosis of how we got there and a credible guide to the sort of &#x201c;out of the box&#x201d; thinking that is likely to get us out of it. After you&#x2019;ve forgotten about the latest wheeze about the financial crisis, you&#x2019;ll be returning to this book.&#x2019; (Steve Fuller, Auguste Comte Chair in Soc)</p><h2>Redeemed Captive</h2><p>When a party of French and Indians attacked Deerfield, Mass., in 1704, 49 people were killed, including Reverend Williams&#39;s wife and two of their children.

Yet confidence in the money supply is a recent phenomenon: prior to the Civil War, the United States did not have a single, national currency. Instead, countless banks issued paper money in a bewildering variety of denominations and designs--more than ten thousand different kinds by 1860. Counterfeiters flourished amid this anarchy, putting vast quantities of bogus bills into circulation.</p><p>Their success, Stephen Mihm reveals, is more than an entertaining tale of criminal enterprise: it is the story of the rise of a country defined by a freewheeling brand of capitalism over which the federal government exercised little control. It was an era when responsibility for the country's currency remained in the hands of capitalists for whom "making money" was as much a literal as a figurative undertaking.</p><p>Mihm's witty tale brims with colorful characters: shady bankers, corrupt cops, charismatic criminals, and brilliant engravers. Based on prodigious research, it ranges far and wide, from New York City's criminal underworld to the gold fields of California and the battlefields of the Civil War. We learn how the federal government issued greenbacks for the first time and began dismantling the older monetary system and the counterfeit economy it sustained.</p><p><i>A Nation of Counterfeiters</i> is a trailblazing work of history, one that casts the country's capitalist roots in a startling new light. Readers will recognize the same get-rich-quick spirit that lives on in the speculative bubbles and confidence games of the twenty-first century.</p></p><p>Stephen Mihm is Associate Professor of History at the University of Georgia.&#x201c;Mihm brings to teeming life a world most Americans never knew existed, a world in which every single purchase was inflected with an additional layer of anxiety about the very currency in which the purchase was to be transacted.

There really is nothing like it in the literature.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Bruce H. Mann, Harvard Law School</b><br><br>&#x201c;Stephen Mihm's elegant study demonstrates that 'making money' once had a more literal meaning, when thousands of banks printed their own currency notes and numerous counterfeiters profitably imitated them. Mihm offers an absorbing and enlightening history of the complex relations between money, national stability, and the forging of American character.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Richard Sylla, New York University</b><br><br>&#x201c;With imaginative research and crystalline prose, Stephen Mihm casts unprecedented light on the confidence games at the heart of early American capitalism. He also introduces us to an irresistible cast of characters, whose brazen exploits provide a new frame for understanding nineteenth century economic debate. <i>A Nation of Counterfeiters</i> is a brilliant synthesis of business and cultural history. This is a book to take seriously.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Jackson Lears, author of <i>Something for Nothing: Luck in America</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Mihm vividly and entertainingly describes the muddled and often fraudulent economy of pre-greenback America: those freewheeling, pre&#x2013;Civil War days when the federal government not only did not print paper money but likewise did not bother to regulate those regional banks that did.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Marvelously entertaining...There are enough shifty characters and bizarre incidents in here to outfit a hundred novels.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Roger K.

Moving fluidly between the insurgent art of the 1960&#x2019;s and the intersectional activism of the present day, Afro-Fabulations challenges genealogies of blackness that ignore its creative capacity to exceed conditions of traumatic loss, social death, and archival erasure.<br><br>If black survival in an anti-black world often feels like a race against time, Afro-Fabulations looks to the modes of memory and imagination through which a queer and black polytemporality is invented and sustained. Moving past the antirelational debates in queer theory, Nyong&#x2019;o posits queerness as &#x201c;angular sociality,&#x201d; drawing upon queer of color critique in order to name the gate and rhythm of black social life as it moves in and out of step with itself. He takes up a broad range of sites of analysis, from speculative fiction to performance art, from artificial intelligence to Blaxploitation cinema. Reading the archive of violence and trauma against the grain, Afro-Fabulations summons the poetic powers of queer world-making that have always been immanent to the fight and play of black life.</p></p><p><b>Tavia Nyong&#x2019;o</b> is Professor of African American Studies, American Studies, and Theater &amp; Performance Studies at Yale University and the author of <i>Afro-Fabulations: The Queer Drama of Black Life</i> (2018)."To afro-fabulate is to listen to and know the ongoing history of anti-black racism, but also to rebuke it by telling another story. In showing us how artists and performers engage in this act of telling, Nyongo offers not only a compelling new way to think about works that challenge history, narrative, and truth, but also a method in which we might continue that work." (<i>Brooklyn Rail</i>)<br><br>"The imaginative power of Nyong&#x2019;o&#x2019;s words, his push to reimagine chronology and time through the optics of Blackness and his insistence on the intellectual stakes of Afrofabulatory ambivalence stuck with me, reminding me of the importance of the ephemeral, the everyday, and the speculative."

When a horrific car crash kills a Forest teenager, Angela is among the first on the scene. Her investigation is hardly underway, however, when she suffers a series of crippling strokes. Misdiagnosed by the resident neurologist, Dr. Gravois, and mended by gauche yet brilliant neurosurgeon Dr. Jeb Travis Tritt, Angela faces a harrowing recovery.</p><p>It&#x2019;s a drug-addled, hallucinating Angela who learns that Dr. Gravois has been murdered...and the chief suspect is the surgeon who saved her life.

The largest of them, probably the estuarine or saltwater crocodile, Crocodylus porosus, can grow to almost twenty feet and weigh more than two thousand pounds. Crocodylians are creatures of great contrast. They can remain patiently still for ages, yet can also move like lightning to snap up a meal. They are formidably strong, active predators, with jaws that can tear apart large prey items, yet a mother or a father can gently assist hatchlings out of the eggs, and carry them to the water between their teeth. Because large crocodylians can (and do) eat people, they invite fear and loathing, but they also inspire curiosity and admiration. </p><p><i>Biology and Evolution of Crocdylians</i> is a comprehensive review of current knowledge about the world&#x2019;s largest and most famous living reptiles. Gordon Grigg&#x2019;s authoritative and accessible text and David Kirshner&#x2019;s stunning artwork and color photographs combine expertly in this contemporary celebration of crocodiles, alligators, caimans, and gharials. This book showcases the skills and capabilities that allow crocodylians to live how and where they do. It covers the biology and ecology of the extant species, conservation issues, crocodilian-human interaction, and the evolutionary history of the group. </p><p>Richly illustrated with more than five hundred color photographs and black-and-white illustrations, this book will be a benchmark reference work for crocodylian biologists, herpetologists, and vertebrate biologists for years to come.</p></p><p><p>Gordon Grigg is Emeritus Professor of Biological Sciences at the University of Queensland.

Now, eighteen years after the publication of <i>The Pillars of the Earth</i>, Ken Follett has written the most-anticipated sequel of the year, <i>World Without End</i>.</b> <br><br> In 1989 Ken Follett astonished the literary world with <i>The Pillars of the Earth</i>, a sweeping epic novel set in twelfth-century England centered on the building of a cathedral and many of the hundreds of lives it affected. Critics were overwhelmed--"it will hold you, fascinate you, surround you" (<i>Chicago Tribune</i>)--and readers everywhere hoped for a sequel. <br><br> <i>World Without End</i> takes place in the same town of Kingsbridge, two centuries after the townspeople finished building the exquisite Gothic cathedral that was at the heart of <i>The Pillars of the Earth</i>. The cathedral and the priory are again at the center of a web of love and hate, greed and pride, ambition and revenge, but this sequel stands on its own. This time the men and women of an extraordinary cast of characters find themselves at a crossroad of new ideas--about medicine, commerce, architecture, and justice. In a world where proponents of the old ways fiercely battle those with progressive minds, the intrigue and tension quickly reach a boiling point against the devastating backdrop of the greatest natural disaster ever to strike the human race--the Black Death. <br><br> Three years in the writing, and nearly eighteen years since its predecessor, <i>World Without End</i> breathes new life into the epic historical novel and once again shows that Ken Follett is a masterful author writing at the top of his craft. <p></p> <p> <strong>Questions for Ken Follett</strong> </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> What a phenomenon <i>The Pillars of the Earth</i> has become. It was a bestseller when it was published in 1989, but it's only gained in popularity since then--it's the kind of book that people are incredibly passionate about. What has it been like to see it grow an audience like that? </p><p> <strong>Follett:</strong> At first I was a little disappointed that <i>Pillars</i> sold not much better than my previous book. Now I think that was because it was a little different and people were not sure how to take it. As the years went by and it became more and more popular, I felt kind of vindicated. And I was very grateful to readers who spread the news by word of mouth. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> <i>Pillars</i> was a departure for you from your very successful modern thrillers, and after writing it you returned to thrillers. Did you think you'd ever come back to the medieval period? What brought you to do so after 18 years? </p><p> <strong>Follett:</strong> The main reason was the way people talk to me about <i>Pillars</i>. Some readers say, "It&#x2019;s the best book I&#x2019;ve ever read." Others tell me they have read it two or three times. I got to the point where I really had to find out whether I could do that again. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> In <i>World Without End</i> you return to Kingsbridge, the same town as the previous book, but two centuries later. What has changed in two hundred years? </p><p><strong>Follett:</strong> In the time of Prior Philip, the monastery was a powerful force for good in medieval society, fostering education and technological advance. Two hundred years later it has become a wealthy and conservative institution that tries to hold back change. This leads to some of the major conflicts in the story. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> <i>World Without End</i> features two strong-willed female characters, Caris and Gwenda. What room to maneuver did a medieval English town provide for a woman of ambition? </p><p> <strong>Follett:</strong> Medieval people paid lip-service to the idea that women were inferior, but in practice women could be merchants, craftspeople, abbesses, and queens. There were restrictions, but strong women often found ways around them. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> When you sit down to imagine yourself into the 14th century, what is the greatest leap of imagination you have to make from our time to theirs? Is there something we can learn from that age that has been lost in our own time? </p><p> <strong>Follett:</strong> It&#x2019;s hard to imagine being so dirty. People bathed very rarely, and they must have smelled pretty bad. And what was kissing like in the time before toothpaste was invented? </p>Ken Follett was twenty-seven when he wrote Eye of the Needle, an award-winning thriller that became an international bestseller. He then surprised everyone with The Pillars of the Earth, about the building of a cathedral in the Middle Ages, which continues to captivate millions of readers all over the world and its long-awaited sequel, World Without End, was a number one bestseller in the US, UK and Europe and was followed by the third novel in the Kingsbridge series A Column of Fire. He has written the bestselling Century trilogy, which comprises Fall of Giants, Winter of the World and Edge of Eternity.</p><h2>Mecca the Blessed, Medina the Radiant: The Holiest Cities of Islam</h2><p><i>Mecca the Blessed, Medina the Radiant</i> is an unprecedented photographic exploration of the holiest cities of Islam and the Hajj, or annual pilgrimage during Ramadan when more than a million faithful journey to Mecca's Great Mosque to commemorate the first revelation of the Qur'an (Koran).<br><br>This book allows both Muslims and those unfamiliar with the Islamic faith complete access to the holiest sites of one of the world's major religions, practiced by a quarter of the world's population but often misunderstood in the West.<br><br>Photographer Ali Kazuyoshi Namachi, a Muslim convert from Japan, garnered the full support of Saudi Arabian authorities&#x2014;rarely given&#x2014;to shoot in cities where photography is strictly controlled, and non-Muslims are not allowed.<br><br>An expansive work of photojournalism, <i>Mecca the Blessed, Medina the Radiant</i> includes:<br><ul><li>140 full-color, never-before-seen photographs</li><li>Mystical places and scenes of Islam</li><li>Breathtaking aerial photographs of the Arabian terrain</li><li>Vistas of teeming crowds of worshippers surrounding the Kasbah, Mecca's sacred center</li><li>Intense portraits of faithful Muslims in prayer</li><li>Magnificent architecture reflecting the faith of the believers</li><li>Archival illustrations</li></ul><br>Text by Seyyed Hossein Nasr, one of the most highly regarded scholars of Islam, enhances the stunning Islamic holy city photographs to illuminate many aspects of Islamic belief that have remained enigmatic to non-Muslims&#x2014;until now.</p><p>These photographs of the Muslim holy cities Mecca and Medina, taken by a Japanese convert, Ali Kazuyoshi Nomachi, are something new for most Westerners, and perhaps even for many Muslims. Non-Muslims are never allowed into Mecca, and it is almost unheard-of for religious and government leaders to allow such pictures to be taken. Most of these images were shot during the holy month of Ramadan, when many faithful are in Mecca and Medina on pilgrimage. <p> Dr. Seyyed Hossein Nasr, professor of Islamic studies at George Washington University, has contributed an essay explaining the history and significance of the two cities. "Mecca and its twin city Medina flourish as the heart and sacred Center of the Islamic universe and will continue to do so as long as there are men and women who accept the truth of Lailaha illa'Llah and Muhammadun rasul Allah," he writes. </p><p> Nomachi has worked for <i>National Geographic</i> and <i>Life</i>, and his pictures have the information-packed clarity one might expect. There are fascinating images: literally hundreds of thousands of white-robed believers circling the Ka'bah, Mecca's sacred center; men ritually shaving one another's heads; tired families fasting; small children praying. Nomachi's pictures are oddly cool, but they convey the all-encompassing nature of the faith. <i>Mecca the Blessed, Medina the Radiant</i> will be especially thrilling to those Muslims still planning their pilgrimage.</p>Mecca the blessed, Medina the Radiant is a remarkable achievement by Japanese photographer Ali Kazuyoshi Nomachi, who is a convert to Islam. These never-before-seen images provide an opening to the mystical places and scenes of Islam from breathtaking aerial photographs of the Arabian terrain, to vistas of teeming crowds of worshippers surrounding the Ka&#39;bah, to intense portraits of faithful Muslims in prayer, to the magnificent architecture reflecting the faith of the believers. Despite Islam&#39;s position as a powerful religion, many aspects of Muslim thought and belief remain an enigma to non-Muslims. One reason may be that Mecca and Medina are restricted to Muslims, and photographing the sites requires special permission, rarely given, from the Saudi Arabian authorities. With their support, photographer Ali Kazuyoshi Nomachi has been able to accomplish this unique mission.</p><h2>Outrageous Love, Transforming Power: How the Holy Spirit Shapes You into the Likeness of Christ</h2><p>Terry Wardle presents compelling evidence that countless churches are made up of people who seem perpetually caught in spiritual infancy.

"All the best lodgings will have been taken by the look of it!"<br><br>The rutted streets were crammed with elegant traffic more at home in Paris, from which most of them had come, than in these countrified surroundings. The sun glinted on gilded coachwork and harness, the warm air hazy with dust thrown up by wheels and hooves. Six hundred of the nobility had been invited to the first grandfete ever to be held at the nearby hunting lodge, which was a small place with only accommodation enough for a few of the king's special guests to stay.<br><br>"Is it any use trying the inns to see if there's a room left?" asked one of his companions as they moved their tired horses forward at a more restful pace. "There are three hostelries, I believe."<br><br>"I'd say we've lost that chance, Leon. See! Even those miserable hovels have been taken." Augustin flicked his gloved hand toward some old stone houses they were passing. Well-dressed arrivals were stepping fastidiously inside, never having set foot in such humble places before, their servants carrying in their boxes and baggage after them. "Those we left behind us on the road will be lucky to get a stable at this rate."<br><br>He was the natural leader of their high-spirited group. They had become friends during their initial year's service with the First Company of the King's Musketeers, a duty expected of every young courtier who wished for promotion at Court. Not yet twenty, born of Huguenot stock and of a father with powerful financial interests, Augustin was tall with a straight bearing and a good physique, his looks dashing and debonair.<br><br>Like most youths of his age, he scorned the fashionable full-bottomed periwig and wore his own hair, which was thick, curly, and long enough to rest on his broad shoulders in the modish style. Its luxuriant growth, black shot with blueish lights, framed features hardening into the square jaw and prominent nose of his forebears. Beneath thick brows the narrow eyes were a curiously brilliant green and there was a lusty eagerness in the lines of the wide mouth. As always when he was with these particular friends, Leon Postel, Francois Esconde, and Jacques de Fresnay, any excuse for a prank or horseplay was seized on with relish. They had enlivened the ride from Paris with a number of diversions, such as racing each other dangerously, swerving in front of coach horses, and flirting with pretty women riding together in the lumbering equipages.<br><br>"At least let us stop for a swig of wine first." Francois eased a gloved finger around the inside of his lace-trimmed neck band, his freckled face gleaming with beads of sweat.<br><br>"Agreed!" Jacques, hawk-faced and fair-haired, made exaggerated gasping sounds. "I'm parched from the dust of the ride. There's a wineshop ahead."<br><br>"We can't afford to stop yet." Augustin twisted in his saddle to signal his own servant forward from the retinue of valets who had now caught up in the rear, bringing with them the extra horses with saddle hampers and chests of clothes. "Get a few bottles of the best wine this place can provide," he instructed, "and follow me."<br><br>The wine, coarse and rough though it was, proved welcome when the search for accommodation brought no result. While the servants did the knocking on doors, Augustin and his companions tossed it back from their silver traveling cups. Its potency took full effect as the rising heat of noon combined with their deep thirst, Leon's swarthy complexion almost reaching the same hue as the wine itself. All four of them became more boisterous and everything seemed excruciatingly funny to them. There was plenty to amuse as women accidentally set satin-shod feet into cow dung, sometimes causing a loss of balance amid squeals of temper and dismay, and fellow gallants, who were no more used to inconveniences than they were themselves, sprang off their horses to kick and cuff their unfortunate servants for failing to get a room for them in the last of the tolerable property.<br><br>The local priest had opened his house for some of the women out of sympathy for their plight, but he ran like a schoolboy, his black robes flapping, to lock the doors of the twelfth-century church before anyone thought to bed down there. He knew as well as anybody that there would inevitably be drunkenness and every other kind of indulgence before the royal fete was at an end. Augustin, laughing, wheeled his black horse about with a sheen of flanks to the church steps and leaned from the saddle to offer him a cup of wine. It was refused with uplifted white palms before the priest went scurrying back to his house.<br><br>Gradually the search spread from the center of the village to the outskirts. Versailles, situated as it was on the main road between Normandy and Paris, was better able to house travelers than the neighboring hamlets, but already some people had set off for Clagny and Saint-Cyr and Trianon in the hope of snatching up the best accommodation there, not knowing that they could not expect even a moderation of comfort in those poverty-stricken hamlets.<br><br>Augustin's servant, dodging in front of one of these departing coaches as he returned from a row of mean-looking stone cottages, gave his information breathlessly. "All rooms have been claimed, except in the end one where the housewife is in labor and nobody is being accommodated."<br><br>Augustin raised an eyebrow incredulously. "Do you mean that space has been found at last and admittance refused?"<br><br>"The woman is almost at birthing point--"<br><br>"Out of my way!" Augustin swung himself down from the saddle and turned to the other three with a sweep of his arm. "Come along, my friends! If this were a royal birth, it would be our noble right to witness the delivery! A peasant woman has no cause to keep us out!"<br><br>He made for the cottage. Whooping and shouting as if going into battle, the trio dismounted and rushed after him. The door was on the latch and he flung it wide as he entered, those in his wake following close behind, the heels of their riding boots ringing on the flagstones. They found themselves in the single whitewashed room that served all purposes. Sparsely furnished with a rough-hewn table, a dresser, and benches, it was stiflingly hot, the windows tightly shut. A midwife swung around from a bed in the far corner, her sleeves rolled up above her elbow, her apron soiled and her sweaty red face a mask of outrage at this intrusion. Deftly she flicked a corner of the sheet over the bare updrawn legs of the groaning woman she was tending before taking up a belligerent stance with feet apart and arms akimbo.<br><br>"Messieurs! You must leave this instant! Madame Dremont is unable to wait on anyone and there is no place for you here."<br><br>A scream of torment compelled her to turn back to her charge. The woman in labor, regaining her breath, raised her head weakly from the pillow. "Who has come?"<br><br>The midwife reached out to pull the ragged bed-curtain across and block the view, but her action came too late. Jeanne Dremont's pain-filled eyes became drenched with horror as she saw the four youths advancing toward her. She began to shriek hysterically, releasing the labor rope strung across the bed to clutch frantically at the midwife's hand.<br><br>"Make them go away! Have I not endured enough this day?"<br><br>Augustin thrust the curtain far back on its rings and looked down at her. She was about thirty-five but looked much older, her gaunt bones having taken over from the bloom of youth. Her faded hair, with some traces of red, was darkened by sweat and her lips were drawn back grotesquely in her mental and physical agony. Compassion for her moved him.<br><br>"Don't be alarmed, madame," he assured her kindly, the wine making his tone jocular. "We don't want your bed. Some clean blankets and fresh lice-free straw will suffice for us."<br><br>She drew breath and tried to answer him, seeing he meant her no harm, but a new wave of pain defeated her, cutting her through. It was hard not to believe she was caught up in a terrible, whirling nightmare. Young male grins and laughing eyes were at the side of her bed, cheering her on as though she were a racehorse nearing the winning post. She did not know that the queens of France had to suffer the same public witness. The midwife, no time left for argument, had elbowed her way free to be ready for the moment of birth and was coaxing her toward it amid the uproar. All decency had flown. Even a doctor delivered under a modesty blanket, but whatever had been covering her seemed to have fallen away. She heard her own ear-splitting scream as she thrust against the final ripping apart of her body, her back arching like a bow. With a rush the baby came. As its wail went up there was a burst of applause from the noblemen. The one she heard addressed as Augustin gave her the news before the midwife had a chance.<br><br>"It's a girl! You have a fine daughter, madame!"<br><br>In exhaustion, she let herself sink deep into the mattress of goose feathers, eyes closed and a smile on her lips. She no longer cared about anything else. The baby's lusty wailing was music to her. After several stillbirths and more miscarriages, she had a living child. "Give her to me," she implored in an exultant whisper.<br><br>The midwife had cut the cord and wrapped the infant in a piece of linen. When she would have handed her over to the mother, Augustin snatched the human bundle away and swept the newborn infant high into the air, regarding her fondly.<br><br>"You're like a crumpled little flower, mademoiselle," he joked, making swooping circles with her. His friends came to gather around, laughing as they shoved and pushed each other. In the bed Jeanne reached out her arms, gripped by panic at this new turn of drunken horseplay. She was terrified they might start throwing the infant to each other like a ball.<br><br>"Let me have her, sir! I beg you!"<br><br>He took no notice, continuing to address the baby whose pouched lids blinked at him over an unfocused gaze, her lungs continuing to give forth a newborn cry. "A bloom from the meadows and dung-heaps of Versailles, that's what you are, ma petite. Marguerite is a name that would suit you. Yes, I name you Marguerite." His friends cheered noisily. Jeanne would have struggled from the bed if the midwife had not restrained her. "In seventeen years," he continued laughingly, "Jacques and Francois and Leon and I will be back to court you. Pay no attention to them. I'll be the one for you. In the meantime here's a token of my good faith." He had a louis d'or in his pocket and as he gave the infant into her mother's arms he pressed it into her tiny fingers. "See how she clutches it, madame! She'll be an expensive wife for a man to keep when the time comes."<br><br>Jeanne, whose tears had been streaming down her face in her fright, turned her shoulder to him as she settled the infant protectively against her. He bowed to them both and pulled the curtain across to leave them on their own with the midwife.<br><br>When Theo Dremont hurried home from work there was little hope in him that his wife's labor, which had started in the early hours before sunrise, would have proved any more productive than on previous occasions. After each one Jeanne had become more difficult and at times quite strange in the head. He had had to take a stick to beat the sense back into her too often for his liking, but his reputation in the village had to be considered and no one respected a man not seen to master domestic upheavals in his own house. After a few months of constant weeping, Jeanne had adjusted once again. If after every disappointment she was a little less stable than before, only he knew it.<br><br>His mouth fell agape as he stopped in the doorway of his house and saw its disarray. There was no sign of the neighbor who should have had a cooked dinner ready for him. Instead two dandy menservants in doublets and petticoat breeches with ribbons at the knees, aprons about their waists, were removing from the table the remains of what appeared to have been a grand meal judging by the number of chicken bones and emptied wine bottles.<br><br>All the windows stood open and under them were four mounds of clean straw that had been shaped into beds, with a satin-lined cloak on each in lieu of blankets. A row of riding boots, newly polished, stood beside some traveling chests stacked against the wall. From the scaffolding around a barn he was building for a farmer, he had seen throughout the day the nobility descending like a great flock of peacocks on the village and he realized full well that his cottage had been taken over. Yet the question still burst from him.<br><br>"What's going on here?"<br><br>The two menservants looked condescendingly at him. They had seen their masters rigged out in best clothes and off to the royal lodge before they and their fellows had cooked and enjoyed a good meal themselves out of supplies brought with them. Although of peasant stock, they adopted the rank of their masters in the hierarchy of the servant world and thought themselves well above this thick-shouldered, coarse-featured artisan in his dirty brick-laying clothes. The taller of the two pointed to a leather purse on the windowsill.<br><br>"That's your payment and there'll be more when our masters are ready to leave."<br><br>Theo snatched up the purse and tipped the contents into his calloused palm. His eyes gleamed. The longer the king's fete lasted the better as far as he was concerned. As he pocketed the purse he remembered what had brought him home with more haste than usual. He looked toward the bed. The curtains were drawn and there was silence. With a depressed sigh he turned to hang up his hat, only to find every peg taken up with riding coats and headgear. He put his own hat on the floor. Crossing to the bed he drew back the curtains, expecting to find Jeanne lying stark-eyed and immobile with disappointment.</p><h2>Unquenchable: Grow a Wildfire Faith that Will Endure Anything</h2><p><p>Where is your faith today&#x2015;first sparks of faith, bright blue flames, radiating heat, raging bonfire, red-hot coals,<strong> </strong>cooling embers, cold grey ashes?&nbsp; Is your love for God burning so brightly that you are consumed by its passion?&nbsp; Are those who surround you drawn to its radiance and warmed by its heat?&nbsp; Are sparks flying from you, spreading a wildfire faith that ignites passion in others?</p><p>Or has your passion cooled, your light dimmed, or your fire been quenched?</p><p>Throughout history God has chosen fire to represent his awesome power, his judgment and wrath, his protection, and his Shekinah glory: the flaming sword guarding Eden, the burning bush, the pillar of fire, the fiery furnace, the chariot of fire, the burning coal, the flame upon the altar, the lake of fire, and the flaming eyes of the Son of Man upon the throne&#x2015;these are only a few of the images he has seared into our minds that we might know him more fully.</p><p>God is the source of that first flicker that sparked your faith and one day you will stand in his holy presence, look into the flaming eyes of Jesus, and see his burning love for you face to face.&nbsp; But between that first flicker and that heavenly meeting, there is life to be lived on this earth.&nbsp; The challenge we all face is that life can dim our fire or even quench it, whether by the soggy mist of the mundane, or the quenching downpour of crisis.</p><p>Carol Kent has discovered that God&#x2019;s Word is filled with the secrets of nurturing his fire in our lives, sometimes painfully so, other times even undetected, refining, purifying, cauterizing, healing, and ultimately reshaping us into the image of his Son.</p><p>Author and speaker Carol Kent will take you into God&#x2019;s word, and into your own story, to reveal the true power of the fire God has placed in you, to fan the flames of your faith, stir your passion, and embolden you to spark wildfires that will spread to forever change the landscape of this world beyond your wildest imagination.</p><p>God&#x2019;s fire is in your life.&nbsp; Fan the flames.&nbsp; Burn brightly.

Like the psychomagic and metagenealogy therapies he created, this autobiography exposes the mythic models and family templates upon which the events of everyday life are founded. It reveals the development of Jodorowsky&#x2019;s realization that all problems are rooted in the family tree and explains, through vivid examples from his own life, particularly interactions with his father and mother, how the individual&#x2019;s road to true fulfillment means casting off the phantoms projected by parents on their children. <br> <br><i>The Dance of Reality</i> is autobiography as an act of healing. Through the retelling of his own life, the author shows we do not start off with our own personalities, they are given to us by one or more members of our family tree. To be born into a family, Jodorowsky says, is to be possessed. To peer back into our past is equivalent to digging into our own souls. If we can dig deep enough, beyond familial projections, we shall find an inner light--a light that can help us through life&#x2019;s most difficult tests. <br> <br>Offering a glimpse into the mind and life of one of the most creative and enigmatic visionaries of our time, <i>The Dance of Reality</i> is the book upon which Jodorowsky&#x2019;s critically acclaimed 2013 Cannes Film Festival film of the same name was based.</p><p>Alejandro Jodorowsky is a filmmaker who made the legendary cult films <i>El Topo</i> and <i>The Holy Mountain</i>.

The biblical sermon is not immune to the pressure to evolve or even fall by the wayside, leaving pastors and seminary students confused over how best to communicate to today&#x2019;s listeners. In this forward-looking textbook, Kenton Anderson delivers a strong call to current and future ministers to indeed choose to preach biblical sermons, despite the obstacles to doing so. While preaching itself is non-negotiable, the exact form it takes can be much more flexible, allowing people to hear from God as they hear his Word preached. Rather than presenting one model or process for preparing a sermon, Anderson explains several available options. As you discern your message from the Bible, will you begin with the text (deductive) or with the listener (inductive)? Will you focus on the idea (cognitive) or the image (affective)? The choices you make lead to five possible sermon structures: � DECLARATIVE&#x2015;make an argument � PRAGMATIC&#x2015;solve a mystery � NARRATIVE&#x2015;tell a story � VISIONARY&#x2015;paint a picture � INTEGRATIVE&#x2015;sing a song Each model is described in detail and related to well-known contemporary preachers, including John MacArthur, Rick Warren, Eugene Lowry, and Rob Bell. This book equips you with a variety of tools for your preaching tool kit. </p></p><p><p>Kenton C.

When we experience the Beautiful, there is a wonderful sense of homecoming; we feel fully alive. Our lives become illuminated, and behind the shudder of appearances we come to glimpse the sure form of things.</p><p>On <i>Beauty: The Invisible Embrace</i>, Irish poet and philosopher John O'Donohue invites us to remember and to awaken the Beautiful; it is always secretly there, awaiting but our attention and reverence in order to come alive.</p><p>Beauty is the true priestess of individuation. But our times are dominated by anxiety and by what is vulgar, coarse, and artificial. Were Beauty to awaken in the fields of politics, religion, planning, discourse, and seeing, our world would heal, and fresh wells of hope would refresh us. Kathleen Raine, the English poet says: "Strangest of all is the ease with which the vision is lost, consciousness contracts, we forget over and over again, until recollection is stirred by some icon of that beauty. Then we remember and wonder why we ever forgot."</p></p><p>&#34;When we awaken to the call of beauty, we become aware of new ways of being in the world,&#34; teaches John O&#39;Donohue. The beautiful unites your feelings, your thoughts, and your dreams--it brings together all the different dimensions of your life. On Beauty: The Invisible Embrace, O&#39;Donohue inducts listeners into this eternal world that lies beyond form and function. &#34;The human soul is always hungry for beauty. It can be sought everywhere: in landscape, furniture, clothes, love, religion ... and in ourselves,&#34; he explains. Perhaps now, more than ever before, is the time to awaken and invoke beauty. There is a great coarseness in our time; it can be seen in our language, in the way we hold life, and in the way that we behave toward each other. Beauty: The Invisible Embrace offers listeners the opportunity to truly experience the beautiful, which--according to this Irish author, poet, and scholar--is to experience unity with the Divine. Drawing from his own Celtic wisdom and the writings of Keats, Rilke, Thomas Aquinas, and others, John O&#39;Donohue guides listeners through five hours of poetry, vision, and imagination to attune to &#34;that which shows us the surprise at the heart of everything.&#34;<p><b>John O'Donohue</b><br><b>JOHN O'DONOHUE</b> was a poet, philosopher, scholar, and native Gaelic speaker from County Clare, Ireland.

It contains teachings that he considered vital for treading the Buddhist path to liberation, especially for westerners, and that he gave again and again to his Western students. His advice on Buddhist practice is simple and yet profound; it extends from the basics all the way up to the highest teaching of Mahamudra. His words are imbued with an authority and authenticity that comes from having tested these teachings and practices in the fire of his own extraordinary meditative experience. There is no dogma or display of rote learning in this book - everything offered here is heartfelt advice coming from personal experience and constitutes essential fare for the practitioner. The outstanding characteristic of the book is its singular power to inspire the reader to dedicate themselves seriously to Buddhist practice. It will be helpful to newcomers to Buddhism who want a practical and authoritative introduction to its key themes. It will also be of great value to experienced practitioners who will find in it countless gems of advice to help them resolve remaining uncertainties about their Dharma practice. Also included in the book is a lengthy chapter that tells the fascinating tale of Gendun Rinpoche&#39;s life and practice in the monasteries and mountains of Tibet, his escape to India, his interactions with the 16th Karmapa, and his powerful impact on his numerous Western students.</p><p>Gendun Rinpoche (1918&#x2013;1997) belonged to that extraordinary group of great Tibetan Buddhist meditators trained entirely in Tibet who were driven into exile by the Chinese occupation of their homeland and who later in their lives spread the Buddhist teachings in the West. Practicing in the Karma Kagyu tradition, he spent over 30 years meditating in closed retreat in Tibet and India. His accomplishments were such that his principal teacher, the 16th Karmapa, who sent him to Europe to teach, compared him to the great 11/12th century Tibetan yogi Milarepa. In the final years of his activity in Europe he succeeded in firmly planting the Buddhist teachings in Western soil by establishing numerous teaching, practice and retreat centers. He trained more than a hundred Western disciples as teachers or lamas who are now continuing his legacy.</p><h2>When Athens Met Jerusalem: An Introduction to Classical and Christian Thought</h2><p>Christian theology shaped and is shaping many places in the world, but it was the Greeks who originally gave a philosophic language to Christianity. John Mark Reynolds's book <em>When Athens Met Jerusalem</em> provides students a well-informed introduction to the intellectual underpinnings (Greek, Roman and Christian) of Western civilization and highlights how certain current intellectual trends are now eroding those very foundations. This work makes a powerful contribution to the ongoing faith versus reason debate, showing that these two dimensions of human knowing are not diametrically opposed, but work together under the direction of revelation.</p><p><strong>John Mark Reynolds</strong> (Ph.D., University of Rochester) is founder and director of the Torrey Honors Institute and professor of philosophy at Biola University, California. He is the coeditor (with J. P. Moreland) of <em>Three Views on Creation and Evolution.</em>"An excellent book. . .I recommend this resource for all who are in need of a resfresher on the importance of philosophical praxis in our Christian faith."

(Marvin Olasky, World Magazine, March 13, 2010)<br><br>"It's one thing to read an introductory text which gives you the raw description or definition of a particular text or figure, but it's another task entirely to do a good job taking these bits of ancient history, and provide a description that makes ideas, figures, and texts come alive in their original conext; Dr. Reynolds does the latter. Ultimately, in developing this narrative, Dr. Reynolds not only seeks to provide a narrative description of the development of these ideas, but he also wants to highlight the influence of classical thought on the development of Christianity, while also arguing that the loss of this classical influence in modern Christianity has been detrimental. Definitely an intriguing read; check it out!"

(Nancy Pearcey, author of Total Truth: Liberating Christianity from Its Cultural Captivity)<br><br>"John Mark Reynolds is the most stimulating lecturer on the interplay of classical and Christian thought I have ever heard. I have been longing for him to write a book capturing his brilliant ideas on the topic. It is a great blessing that this book has finally arrived--and <em>When Athens Met Jerusalem</em> does not disappoint. It is one of the finest and yet most readable treatments ever in print." (Craig J. Hazen, Ph.D., founder and director of the Christian Apologetics Program, Biola University, and editor of Philosophia Christi)<br><br>"It must be a treat to sit in John Mark Reynolds's classroom. In its verve and intelligence, <em>When Athens Met Jerusalem</em> is the next best thing. I wish I had read a book like this when I was a student. The need is even greater today, when even the teachers turn against reason, and every day makes clearer that Jerusalem is Athens's best friend." (J. Budziszewski, University of Texas at Austin, and author of The Line Through the Heart: Natural Law as Fact, Theory, and Sign of Contradiction)<br><br>"This is a bold, original, salutary book, written with great passion, wonderful wit and deep love. Reynolds argues, convincingly I think, that Athens and Jerusalem, the classical and the Christian cultures, cannot live apart and are both in danger of perishing unless they are brought together in creative harmony. What is so unusual and so compelling about this appeal is that equal weight and equal appreciation are given to both classical learning and Christian faith. Reynolds has indeed accomplished the truly remarkable feat of replacing the ages-old deadlock between reason and revelation, or faith and reason, with a loving and respectful marriage between the two, and thus foretells of and foresees a new beginning for classical civilization and a revitalization of Christian teaching." (Alfred Geier, University of Rochester)</p><h2>The Pine Island Paradox: Making Connections in a Disconnected World (The World As Home)</h2><p>Can the love reserved for family and friends be extended to a place? In her latest book, acclaimed author Kathleen Dean Moore reflects on how deeply the environment is entrenched in the human spirit, despite the notion that nature and humans are somehow separate. Moore's essays, deeply felt and often funny, make connections in what can appear to be a disconnected world. Written in parable form, her stories of family and friends of wilderness excursions with her husband and children, camping trips with students, blowing up a dam, her daughter's arrest for protesting the war in Iraq affirm an impulse of caring that belies the abstract division of humans from nature, of the sacred from the mundane. Underlying these wonderfully engaging stories is the author&#x2019;s belief in a new ecological ethic of care, one that expands the idea of community to include the environment, and embraces the land as family.</p><p>Kathleen Dean Moore is chair of the Department of Philosophy at Oregon State University.Possessing the soul of a poet and the voice of a troubadour, Moore writes luminous essays about what it means to love a place not in the glib way one "loves" a cold drink on a hot day but passionately, a love that is so deep, so ingrained, it must be encoded in one's DNA. A university philosophy professor, Moore brings a refined sensibility to a worldview so precise that it can focus appreciatively on the delicate ballet of microorganisms swimming in a tidal pool, so expansive that it can relate that ballet to the ecology of the world as a whole. The paradox of an island, as Moore observes with elegiac remorse and wonder, is its apparent isolation, a solitude that conceals a teeming universe relentlessly threatened precisely because it remains unseen. Moore, with graceful insight and lyrical eloquence, reveals worlds that dare not be missed, revels in the joy of their discovery, and extols the rewards of their stewardship. <i>Carol Haggas</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

She came to terms with a course of action that allowed her to pursue her life in a way that was right for her. Now, in this wise, compassionate, and deeply personal book, she provides expert guidance for every woman who has ever grappled with the issue of motherhood. In beyond motherhood, Safer and women of all ages from all over the country eloquently share their experiences and offer unique insights into what it really feels like to live this still unconventional life. They describe what factors in their histories, personalities, and circumstances shaped their decision; and how they forged their identities as women without being mothers. They talk with remkable candor about their marriages, their thoughts about aging without offspring, their legacies, and the meaning of their lives. Most compelling of all, they demonstrate how their vitality and passion for life belie any stereotype of childless women as emotionally barren or incomplete. This inspiring book goes beyond the immediate issue of whether to have a child, and offers the essential key to conscious, creative living for every woman, whether she chooses the path to motherhood or not.Jeanne Safer, Ph.D. has been a practicing psychotherapist for more than twenty years.

Roger Bilstein gracefully wends his way through a maze of technical documentation to reveal the important themes of this story. Rarely has such a nuts-and-bolts tale been so gracefully told."&#x2014;Air University Review<br><br>"Easily the best book of the NASA History Series. . . . Starting with the earliest rockets, Bilstein traces the development of the family of massive Saturn launch vehicles that carried the Apollo astronauts to the moon and boosted Skylab into orbit."&#x2014;Technology and Culture<br><br>A classic study of the development of the Saturn launch vehicle that took Americans to the moon in the 1960s and 1970s, Stages to Saturn is one of the finest official histories ever produced. The Saturn rocket was developed as a means of accomplishing President John F. Kennedy's goal for the United States to reach the moon before the end of the decade. Without the Saturn V rocket, with its capability of sending as payload the Apollo Command and Lunar Modules--along with support equipment and three astronauts--more than a quarter of a million miles from earth, Kennedy's goal would have been unrealizable. Stages to Saturn not only tells the important story of the research and development of the Saturn rockets and the people who designed them but also recounts the stirring exploits of their operations, from orbital missions around earth testing Apollo equipment to their journeys to the moon and back.&nbsp;&nbsp;Essential reading for anyone seeking to understand the development of space flight in America and the course of modern technology, this reprint edition includes a new preface by the author providing a 21st-century perspective on the historic importance of the Saturn project.<br><br>Roger E.

It is a first-class organisational and technological history, and it stands alone as perhaps the very best of the overall government &#x2018;official histories.&#x2019;&#x201d;&#x2015;<i><b>Balloons to Drones</b></i></p>
